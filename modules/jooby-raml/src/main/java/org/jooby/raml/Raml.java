 *       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
 *       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
 *       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
 *       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

 *       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 *       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

 *       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
 *       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 *       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

 *       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 *       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
 *       as of the date such litigation is filed.
 *
 *    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
 *       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
 *       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
 *       meet the following conditions:

 *           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 *
 *       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
 *           stating that You changed the files; and
 *
 *       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
 *           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
 *           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
 *           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 *           the Derivative Works; and
 *
 *       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
 *           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 *           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 *           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 *           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 *           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 *           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 *           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 *           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 *           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 *           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 *           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 *           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 *           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 *           as modifying the License.
 *
 *       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 *       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 *    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 *       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 *       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *
 *    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 *       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 *       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 *       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 *       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 *       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 *
 *    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 *
 *    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 *
 *    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
 *
 *       To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
 *       boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
 *       replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include

/**
 * <h1>raml</h1>
 * <p>
 * RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) makes it easy to manage the whole API lifecycle from design
 * to sharing. It's concise - you only write what you need to define - and reusable. It is machine
 * readable API design that is actually human friendly. More at
 * <a href="http://raml.org/">http://raml.org</a>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>NOTE:</strong> This modules depends on {@link RouteSpec}, please read the
 * {@link RouteSpec} to learn how to use this tool.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>usage</h2>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   // define your API... via script or MVC:
 *   /{@literal *}{@literal *}
 *     {@literal *} Everything about your pets
 *     {@literal *}/
 *    use("/api/pets")
 *       /{@literal *}{@literal *}
 *        {@literal *} Get a pet by ID.
 *        {@literal *} &#64;param id Pet ID
 *        {@literal *}/
 *      .get("/:id", req {@literal ->} {
 *        int id = req.param("id").intValue();
 *        DB db = req.require(DB.class);
 *        Pet pet = db.find(Pet.class, id);
 *        return pet;
 *      })
 *      ...;
 *
 *   new Raml().install(this);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * You also need the <code>jooby:spec</code> maven plugin:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &lt;plugin&gt;
 *   &lt;groupId&gt;org.jooby&lt;/groupId&gt;
 *   &lt;artifactId&gt;jooby-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
 *   &lt;executions&gt;
 *     &lt;execution&gt;
 *       &lt;goals&gt;
 *         &lt;goal&gt;spec&lt;/goal&gt;
 *       &lt;/goals&gt;
 *     &lt;/execution&gt;
 *   &lt;/executions&gt;
 * &lt;/plugin&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The plugin compiles the API and produces a <code>.spec</code> file for prod environments.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The RAML api-console will be available at <code>/raml</code> and the <code>.raml</code> will be
 * at: <code>/raml/api.raml</code>
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>options</h2>
 * <p>
 * There are a few options available, let's see what they are:
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>path</h3>
 * <p>
 * The <code>path</code> option controls where to mount the RAML routes:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   ...
 *   new Raml("docs").install(this);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Produces: <code>/docs</code> for api-console and <code>/docs/api.raml</code>. Default path is:
 * <code>/raml</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>filter</h3>
 * <p>
 * The <code>filter</code> option controls what is exported to <a href="http://raml.org">RAML</a>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   ...
 *   new Raml()
 *     .filter(route {@literal ->} {
 *       return route.pattern().startsWith("/api");
 *     })
 *     .install(this);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Default filter keeps <code>/api/*</code> routes.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>noConsole</h3>
 * <p>
 * This option turn off the api-console:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   ...
 *   new Raml()
 *     .noConsole()
 *     .install(this);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>theme</h3>
 * <p>
 * Set the ui-theme for api-console. Available options are <code>light</code> and <code>dark</code>.
 * Default is: <code>light</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   ...
 *   new Raml()
 *     .theme("dark")
 *     .install(this);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>clientGenerator</h3>
 * <p>
 * Shows/hide the client generator button from api-console.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>tryIt</h3>
 * <p>
 * Expand/collapse the try it panel from api-console.
 * </p>
