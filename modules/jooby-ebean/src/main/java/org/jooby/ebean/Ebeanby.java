/**
 * <h1>ebean module</h1>
 * <p>
 * Object-Relational-Mapping via Ebean. It configures and exposes {@link EbeanServer} instances.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This module extends {@link Jdbc} module, before going forward, make sure you read the doc of the
 * {@link Jdbc} module first.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>usage</h2>
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   use(new Ebeanby().doWith(conf {@literal ->} {
 *    conf.addClass(Pet.class);
 *   }));
 *
 *   get("/pets", req {@literal ->} {
 *     EbeanServer ebean = req.require(EbeanServer.class);
 *     return ebean.createQuery(Pet.class)
 *        .findList();
 *   });
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Usage is pretty straightforward, but of course we need to setup/configure the enhancement.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>enhancement</h2>
 * <p>
 * The enhancement process comes in two flavors:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Runtime: via a JVM Agent</li>
 * <li>Build time: via Maven plugin</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>recommended setup</h3>
 * <p>
 * The recommended setup consist of setting up both: runtime and build time enhancement.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The runtime enhancer increases developer productivity, it let you start your app from IDE
 * and/or <code>mvn jooby:run</code>. All you have to do is to add the agent dependencies to your
 * classpath:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &lt;dependency&gt;
 *   &lt;groupId&gt;org.avaje.ebeanorm&lt;/groupId&gt;
 *   &lt;artifactId&gt;avaje-ebeanorm-agent&lt;/artifactId&gt;
 *   &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
 * &lt;/dependency&gt;
 *
 * &lt;dependency&gt;
 *   &lt;groupId&gt;org.avaje&lt;/groupId&gt;
 *   &lt;artifactId&gt;avaje-agentloader&lt;/artifactId&gt;
 *   &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
 * &lt;/dependency&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Did you see the <code>test scope</code>? We don't want to use the runtime enhancer while
 * running in prod. Instead, we want to use the build time enhancer.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All you have to do is to add <code>avaje-ebeanorm-mavenenhancer</code> to your
 * <code>pom.xml</code> as described in the
 * <a href="http://ebean-orm.github.io/docs#enhance_maven">official doc</a>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Alternative, and because we want to keep our <code>pom.xml</code> small, you can drop a
 * <code>ebean.activator</code> file inside the <code>src/etc/mvn</code> folder. The presence of the
 * file <code>src/etc/mvn/ebean.activator</code> will trigger the
 * <code>avaje-ebeanorm-mavenenhancer</code> plugin.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>configuration</h2>
 * <p>
 * Configuration is done via <code>.conf</code>, for example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * ebean.ddl.generate=false
 * ebean.ddl.run=false
 *
 * ebean.debug.sql=true
 * ebean.debug.lazyload=false
 *
 * ebean.disableClasspathSearch = false
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Or programmatically:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   use(new Ebeanby().doWith(conf {@literal ->} {
 *     conf.setDisableClasspathSearch(false);
 *   }));
 * }
 * </pre>
