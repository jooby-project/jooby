 *       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

/**
 * <h1>couchbase</h1>
 * <p>
 * <a href="http://www.couchbase.com">Couchbase</a> is a NoSQL document database with a distributed
 * architecture for performance, scalability, and availability. It enables developers to build
 * applications easier and faster by leveraging the power of SQL with the flexibility of JSON.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This module provides <a href="http://www.couchbase.com">couchbase</a> access via
 * <a href="https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-java-client">Java SDK</a>
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>exports</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link CouchbaseEnvironment}</li>
 * <li>{@link CouchbaseCluster}</li>
 * <li>{@link AsyncBucket}</li>
 * <li>{@link Bucket}</li>
 * <li>{@link AsyncDatastore}</li>
 * <li>{@link Datastore}</li>
 * <li>{@link AsyncRepository}</li>
 * <li>{@link Repository}</li>
 * <li>Optionally a couchbase {@link Session.Store}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>usage</h2>
 * <p>
 * Via couchbase connection string:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   use(new Couchbase("couchbase://locahost/beers"));
 *
 *   get("/", req -> {
 *     Bucket beers = req.require(Bucket.class);
 *     // do with beer bucket
 *   });
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Via property with a couchbase connection string:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   use(new Couchbase("db"));
 *
 *   get("/", req -> {
 *     Bucket beers = req.require(Bucket.class);
 *     // do with beer bucket
 *   });
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The <code>db</code> property is defined in the <code>application.conf</code> file as a couchbase
 * connection string.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>create, read, update and delete</h2>
 * <p>
 * Jooby provides a more flexible, easy to use and powerful CRUD operations via
 * {@link AsyncDatastore}/{@link Datastore} objects.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *
 * import org.jooby.couchbase.Couchbase;
 * import org.jooby.couchbase.N1Q;
 * ...
 * {
 *   use(new Couchbase("couchbase://localhost/beers"));
 *
 *   use("/api/beers")
 *     .get(req -> {
 *       Datastore ds = req.require(Datastore.class);
 *       return ds.query(N1Q.from(Beer.class));
 *     })
 *     .post(req -> {
 *       Datastore ds = req.require(Datastore.class);
 *       Beer beer = req.body().to(Beer.class);
 *       return ds.upsert(beer);
 *     })
 *     .get(":id", req -> {
 *       Datastore ds = req.require(Datastore.class);
 *       return ds.get(Beer.class, req.param("id").value());
 *     })
 *     .delete(":id", req -> {
 *       Datastore ds = req.require(Datastore.class);
 *       return ds.delete(Beer.class, req.param("id").value());
 *     });
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * As you can see benefits over {@link AsyncRepository}/{@link Repository} are clear: you don't have
 * to deal with {@link EntityDocument} just send or retrieve POJOs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Another good reason is that {@link AsyncDatastore}/{@link Datastore} supports query operations
 * with POJOs too.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>design and implementation choices</h3>
 * <p>
 * The {@link AsyncDatastore}/{@link Datastore} simplifies a lot the integration between Couchbase
 * and POJOs. This section describes how IDs are persisted and how mapping works.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A document persisted by an {@link AsyncDatastore}/{@link Datastore} looks like:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   "model.Beer::1": {
 *     "name": "IPA",
 *     ...
 *     "id": 1,
 *     "_class": "model.Beer"
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The couchbase document ID contains the fully qualified name of the class, plus <code>::</code>
 * plus the entity/business ID: <code>mode.Beer::1</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The business ID is part of the document, here the business ID is: <code>id:1</code>. The business
 * ID is required while creating POJO from couchbase queries.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Finally, a <code>_class</code> attribute is also part of the document. It contains the fully
 * qualified name of the class and its required while creating POJO from couchbase queries.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>mapping pojos</h3>
 * <p>
 * Mapping between document/POJOs is done internally with a custom {@link EntityConverter}. The
 * {@link EntityConverter} uses an internal copy of <code>ObjectMapper</code> object from
 * <code>Jackson</code>. So in <strong>theory</strong> anything that can be handle by
 * <code>Jackson</code> will work.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In order to work with a POJO, you must defined an ID. There are two options:
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * 1. Add an <code>id</code> field to your POJO:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class Beer {
 *   private String id;
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * 2. Use a business name (not necessarily id) and add <code>Id</code> annotation:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *
 * import import com.couchbase.client.java.repository.annotation.Id;
 *
 * public class Beer {
 *   &#64;Id
 *   private String beerId;
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Auto-increment IDs are supported via {@link GeneratedValue}:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *
 * public class Beer {
 *   private Long id;
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Auto-increment IDs are generated using {@link Bucket#counter(String, long, long)} function
 * and they must be <code>Long</code>. We use the POJO fully qualified name as counter ID.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Any other field will be mapped too, you don't need to annotate an attribute with {@link Field}.
 * If you don't want to persist an attribute, just ad the <code>transient</code> Java modifier:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class Beer {
 *   private String id;
 *
 *   private transient ignored;
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Keep in mind that if you annotated your POJO with <code>Jackson</code> annotations they will
 * be ignored... because we use an internal copy of <code>Jackson</code> that comes with
 * <code>Java Couchbase SDK</code>
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>reactive usage</h2>
 * <p>
 * Couchbase SDK allows two programming model: <code>blocking</code> and <code>reactive</code>. We
 * already see how to use the blocking API, now is time to see how to use the <code>reactive</code>
 * API:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   use(new Couchbase("couchbase://localhost/beers"));
 *
 *   get("/", req -> {
 *     AsyncBucket bucket = req.require(AsyncBucket.class);
 *     // do with async bucket ;)
 *   });
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Now, what to do with Observables? Do we have to block? Not necessarily if we use the
 * <code>Rx</code> module:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *
 * import org.jooby.rx.Rx;
 *
 * {
 *   // handle observable route responses
 *   use(new Rx());
 *
 *   use(new Couchbase("couchbase://localhost/beers"));
 *
 *   get("/api/beer/:id", req -> {
 *     AsyncDatastore ds = req.require(AsyncDatastore.class);
 *     String id = req.param("id").value();
 *     Observable<Beer> beer = ds.get(Beer.class, id);
 *     return beer;
 *   });
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The <code>Rx</code> module deal with observables so you can safely return {@link Observable} from
 * routes (Jooby rocks!).
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>multiple buckets</h2>
 * <p>
 * If for any reason your application requires more than 1 bucket... then:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   use(new Couchbase("couchbase://localhost/beers")
 *     .buckets("extra-bucket"));
 *
 *   get("/", req -> {
 *     Bucket bucket = req.require("beers", Bucket.class);
 *     Bucket extra = req.require("extra-bucket", Bucket.class);
 *   });
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Easy, right? Same principle apply for Async* objects
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>multiple clusters</h2>
 * <p>
 * Again, if for any reason your application requires multiple clusters... then:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   CouchbaseEnvironment env = ...;
 *
 *   use(new Couchbase("couchbase://192.168.56.1")
 *      .environment(env));
 *
 *   use(new Couchbase("couchbase://192.168.57.10")
 *      .environment(env));
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * You must shared the {@link CouchbaseEnvironment} as documented <a href=
 * "http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/4.0/sdks/java-2.2/managing-connections.html#story-h2-4">here</a>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>options</h2>
 *
 * <h3>bucket password</h3>
 * <p>
 * You can set a global bucket password via: <code>couchbase.bucket.password</code> property, or
 * local bucket password (per bucket) via <code>couchbase.bucket.[name].password</code> property.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>environment configuration</h3>
 * <p>
 * Environment configuration is available via: <code>couchbase.env</code> namespace, here is an
 * example on how to setup <code>kvEndpoints</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * couchbase.env.kvEndpoints = 3
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>cluster manager</h3>
 * <p>
 * A {@link ClusterManager} service is available is you set an cluster username and password:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * couchbase.cluster.username = foo
 * couchbase.cluster.password = bar
 * </pre>
