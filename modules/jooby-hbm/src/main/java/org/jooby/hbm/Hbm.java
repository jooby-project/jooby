 *       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

 *       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 *       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 *       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

 *       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

 *       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

/**
 * <h1>hibernate</h1>
 * <p>
 * <a href="http://hibernate.org/orm">Hibernate ORM</a> enables developers to more easily write
 * applications whose data outlives the application process. As an Object/Relational Mapping (ORM)
 * framework, Hibernate is concerned with data persistence as it applies to relational databases.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This module setup and configure <a href="http://hibernate.org/orm">Hibernate ORM</a> and
 * <code>JPA Provider</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This module depends on {@link Jdbc} module, make sure you read the doc of the {@link Jdbc}
 * module.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>exports</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>SessionFactory / EntityManagerFactory</li>
 * <li>Session / EntityManager</li>
 * <li>UnitOfWork</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>usage</h2>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   use(new Hbm("jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydb")
 *       .classes(Beer.class)
 *   );
 *
 *   get("/api/beer/", req -> {
 *     return require(UnitOfWork.class).apply(em -> {
 *       return em.createQuery("from Beer").getResultList();
 *     });
 *   });
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>unit of work</h2>
 * <p>
 * We provide an {@link UnitOfWork} to simplify the amount of code required to interact within the
 * database.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example the next line:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   require(UnitOfWork.class).apply(em -> {
 *     return em.createQuery("from Beer").getResultList();
 *   });
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Is the same as:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *    Session session = require(SessionFactory.class).openSession();
 *    Transaction trx = session.getTransaction();
 *    try {
 *      trx.begin();
 *      List<Beer> beers = em.createQuery("from Beer").getResultList();
 *      trx.commit();
 *    } catch (Exception ex) {
 *      trx.rollback();
 *    } finally {
 *      session.close();
 *    }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * An {@link UnitOfWork} takes care of transactions and session life-cycle. It's worth to mention
 * too that a first requested {@link UnitOfWork} bind the Session to the current request. If later
 * in the execution flow an {@link UnitOfWork}, {@link Session} and/or {@link EntityManager} is
 * required then the one that belong to the current request (first requested) will be provided it.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>open session in view</h2>
 * <p>
 * We provide an advanced and recommended <a href=
 * "https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/OpenSessionInView#jive_content_id_Can_I_use_two_transactions_in_one_Session"
 * >Open Session in View</a> pattern, which basically keep the {@link Session} opened until the view
 * is rendered, but it uses two database transactions:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>first transaction is committed before rendering the view and then</li>
 * <li>a read only transaction is opened for rendering the view</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * Here is an example on how to setup the open session in view filter:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *    use(new Hbm());
 *
 *    use("*", Hbm.openSessionInView());
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>event listeners</h2>
 * <p>
 * JPA event listeners are provided by Guice, which means you can inject dependencies into your
 * event
 * listeners:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *
 * &#64;Entity
 * &#64;EntityListeners({BeerListener.class})
 * public class Beer {
 *
 * }
 *
 * public class BeerListener {
 *   &#64;Inject
 *   public BeerListener(DependencyA depA) {
 *     this.depA = depA;
 *   }
 *
 *   &#64;PostLoad
 *   public void postLoad(Beer beer) {
 *     this.depA.complementBeer(beer);
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Hibernate event listeners are supported too via {@link #onEvent(EventType, Class)}:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *    use(new Hbm()
 *        .onEvent(EventType.POST_LOAD, MyPostLoadListener.class));
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Again, <code>MyPostLoadListener</code> will be provided by Guice.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>persistent classes</h2>
 * <p>
 * Persistent classes must be provided at application startup time via
 * {@link #classes(Class...)}:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   use(new Hbm()
 *       .classes(Entity1.class, Entity2.class, ..., )
 *   );
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Or via {@link #scan()}:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   use(new Hbm()
 *       .scan()
 *   );
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Which <code>scan</code> the application package, or you can provide where to look:
 * <p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   use(new Hbm()
 *       .scan("foo.bar", "x.y.z")
 *   );
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>advanced configuration</h2>
 * <p>
 * Advanced configuration is provided via {@link #doWith(Consumer)} callbacks:
 * </p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   use(new Hbm()
 *       .doWith((BootstrapServiceRegistryBuilder bsrb) -> {
 *         // do with bsrb
 *       })
 *       .doWith((StandardServiceRegistryBuilder ssrb) -> {
 *         // do with ssrb
 *       })
 *   );
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Or via <code>hibernate.*</code> property from your <code>.conf</code> file:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *   hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto = update
 * }</pre>
 *
 *
 * <h2>life-cycle</h2>
 * <p>
 * You are free to inject a {@link SessionFactory} or {@link EntityManagerFactory} create a new
 * {@link EntityManagerFactory#createEntityManager()}, start transactions and do everything you
 * need.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For the time being, this doesn't work for a {@link Session} or {@link EntityManager}. A
 * {@link Session} {@link EntityManager} is bound to the current request, which means you can't
 * freely access from every single thread (like manually started thread, started by an executor
 * service, quartz, etc...).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Another restriction, is the access from {@link Singleton} services. If you need access from a
 * singleton services, you need to inject a {@link Provider}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 * &#64;Singleton
 * public class MySingleton {
 *
 *   &#64;Inject
 *   public MySingleton(Provider&lt;EntityManager&gt; em) {
 *     this.em = em;
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Still, we strongly recommend to leave your services in the default scope and avoid to use
 * {@link Singleton} objects, except of course for really expensive resources. This is also
 * recommend it by Guice.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Services in the default scope won't have this problem and are free to inject the
 * {@link Session} or {@link EntityManager} directly.
 * </p>
