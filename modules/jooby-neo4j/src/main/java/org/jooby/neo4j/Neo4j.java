 *           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 *           the Derivative Works; and
 *
 *       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
 *           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 *           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 *           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 *           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one

 *           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 *           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 *           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 *           as modifying the License.
 *
 *       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 *       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify

 *       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

 * <h1>neo4j</h1>
 * <p>
 * <a href="https://neo4j.com">Neo4j</a> is a highly scalable native graph database that leverages
 * data relationships as first-class entities, helping enterprises build intelligent applications to
 * meet today’s evolving data challenges.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This module give you access to <a href="https://neo4j.com">neo4j</a> and
 * <a href="https://github.com/Wolfgang-Schuetzelhofer/jcypher">jcypher</a> APIs.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>exports</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>GraphDatabaseService for embedded neo4j instances.</li>
 * <li>Driver and Session objects for remote instances</li>
 * <li>IDBAccess object</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>usage</h2>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   use(new Neo4j());
 *
 *   get("/driver", () -> {
 *     // work with driver
 *     Driver driver = require(Driver.class);
 *   });
 *
 *   get("/session", () -> {
 *     // work with session
 *     Session session = require(Session.class);

 *
 *   get("/dbaccess", () -> {

 * application.conf
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *  db.url = "bolt://localhost:7687"
 *  db.user = myuser
 *  db.password = mypassword
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>embedded</h2>
 * <p>
 * In addition to remote access using <code>bolt</code> protocol, this module provide
 * access to <code>embedded</code> neo4j instances:
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In memory mode:
 * </p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   use(new Neo4j("mem"));
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * File system mode:
 * </p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   use(new Neo4j("fs"));
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Optionally you can specify the desired path:
 * </p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   use(new Neo4j(Paths.get("path", "mydb")));
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The embedded mode allow you to access {@link GraphDatabaseService} instances:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   use(new Neo4j("mem"));
 *
 *   get("/", () -> {
 *     GraphDatabaseService db = require(GraphDatabaseService.class);
 *   });
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * As well as {@link EmbeddedDBAccess}:
 * </p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   use(new Neo4j("mem"));
 *
 *   get("/", () -> {
 *     EmbeddedDBAccess db = require(EmbeddedDBAccess.class);
 *   });
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>runtime modules</h2>
 * <p>
 * This option is available for <code>embedded</code> Neo4j instances and we allow to configure one
 * or more runtime modules via <code>.conf</code> file:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * com.graphaware.runtime.enabled = true
 *
 * com.graphaware.module = [{
 *   class: com.graphaware.neo4j.expire.ExpirationModuleBootstrapper
 *   nodeExpirationProperty: _expire
 * }, {
 *   class: com.graphaware.neo4j.expire.AnotherModule
 *   modProp: modValue
 * }]
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * You first need to <code>enabled</code> the graph runtime framework by setting the
 * <code>com.graphaware.runtime.enabled</code> property.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Then you need to add one or more modules under the <code>com.graphaware.module</code>
 * property path.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>two or more connections</h2>
 * <p>
 * Two or more connection is available by setting and installing multiples {@link Neo4j} modules:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   use(new Neo4j("db1"));
 *
 *   use(new Neo4j("db2"));
 *
 *   get("/", () -> {
 *     Driver db1 = require("db1", Driver.class);
 *     BoltDBAccess bolt1 = require("db1", BoltDBAccess.class);
 *
 *     Driver db2 = require("db2", Driver.class);
 *     BoltDBAccess bolt2 = require("db2", BoltDBAccess.class);
 *   });
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *

 * <pre>
 *  db1.url = "bolt://localhost:7687"
 *  db1.user = db1user
 *  db1.password = db1pass
 *
 *  db2.url = "bolt://localhost:7687"
 *  db2.user = db2user
 *  db2.password = db2pass
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>options</h2>
 * <p>
 * <a href="https://neo4j.com">Neo4j</a> options are available via <code>.conf</code> file:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * neo4j.dbms.read_only = true
 * neo4j.unsupported.dbms.block_size.array_properties = 120
