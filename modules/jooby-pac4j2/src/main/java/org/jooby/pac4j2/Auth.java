 *       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

 *       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

/**
 * <h1>pac4j module</h1>
 * <p>
 * Authentication module via: <a href="https://github.com/pac4j/pac4j">pac4j</a>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>exposes</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Clients}</li>
 * <li>{@link WebContext} as {@link RequestScoped}</li>
 * <li>{@link Route.Filter} per each registered {@link Client}</li>
 * <li>Callback {@link Route.Filter}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>usage</h2>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *
 *   get("/public", () {@literal ->} ..);
 *
 *   use(new Auth());
 *
 *   get("/private", () {@literal ->} ..);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Previous example adds a very basic but ready to use form login auth every time you try to access
 * to <code>/private</code> or any route defined below the auth module.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>clients</h2>
 * <p>
 * <a href="https://github.com/pac4j/pac4j">pac4j</a> is a powerful library that supports multiple
 * clients and/or authentication protocols. In the next example, we will see how to configure the
 * most basic of them, but also some complex protocols.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>basic auth</h3>
 * <p>
 * If basic auth is all you need, then:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   use(new Auth().basic());
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * A {@link IndirectBasicAuthClient} depends on {@link Authenticator}, default is
 * {@link SimpleTestUsernamePasswordAuthenticator} which is great for development, but nothing good
 * for other environments. Next example setup a basic auth with a custom {@link Authenticator}:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   use(new Auth().basic("*", MyUsernamePasswordAuthenticator.class));
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>form auth</h3>
 * <p>
 * Form authentication will be activated by calling {@link #form()}:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   use(new Auth().form());
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Form is the default authentication method so previous example is the same as:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   use(new Auth());
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Like basic auth, form auth depends on a {@link Authenticator}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A login form will be ready under the path: <code>/login</code>. Again, it is a very basic login
 * form useful for development. If you need a custom login page, just add a route before the
 * {@link Auth} module, like:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   get("/login", () {@literal ->} Results.html("login"));
 *
 *   use(new Auth());
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Simply and easy!
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>oauth, openid, etc...</h3>
 * <p>
 * Twitter, example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   use(new Auth()
 *     .client(conf {@literal ->}
 *        new TwitterClient(conf.getString("twitter.key"), conf.getString("twitter.secret"))));
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Keep in mind you will have to add the require Maven dependency to your project, beside that it is
 * pretty straight forward.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>protecting urls</h2>
 * <p>
 * By default a {@link Client} will protect all the urls defined below the module, because routes in
 * {@link Jooby} are executed in the order they where defined.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can customize what urls are protected by specifying a path pattern:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   use(new Auth().form("/private/**"));
 *
 *   get("/hello", () {@literal ->} "no auth");
 *
 *   get("/private", () {@literal ->} "auth");
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Here the <code>/hello</code> path is un-protected, because the client will intercept everything
 * under <code>/private</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>user profile</h2>
 * <p>
 * Jooby relies on {@link AuthStore} for saving and retrieving a {@link CommonProfile}. By default,
 * the {@link CommonProfile} is stored in the {@link Session} via {@link AuthSessionStore}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * After a successful authentication the {@link CommonProfile} is accessible as a request scoped
 * attribute:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   use(new Auth().form());
 *
 *   get("/private", req {@literal ->} req.require(HttpProfile.class));
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * facebook (or any oauth, openid, etc...)
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   use(new Auth().client(new FacebookClient(key, secret));
 *
 *   get("/private", req {@literal ->} req.require(FacebookProfile.class));
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Custom {@link AuthStore} is provided via {@link Auth#store(Class)} method:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   use(new Auth().store(MyDbStore.class));
 *
 *   get("/private", req {@literal ->} req.require(HttpProfile.class));
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>logout</h2>
 * <p>
 * A default <code>/logout</code> handler is provided it too. The handler will remove the profile
 * from {@link AuthStore} by calling the {@link AuthStore#unset(String)} method. The default login
 * will redirect to <code>/</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A custom logout and redirect urls can be set via <code>.conf</code> file or programmatically:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   use(new Auth().logout("/mylogout", "/redirectTo"));
 * }
 * </pre>
