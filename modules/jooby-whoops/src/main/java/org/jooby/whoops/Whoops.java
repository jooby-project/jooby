 *           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 *           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

 *       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

 *       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

 *       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

/**
 * <h1>whoops</h1>
 * <p>
 * Pretty error page that helps you debug your web application.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>NOTE</strong>: This module is base on <a href="https://github.com/filp/whoops">whoops</a>
 * and uses the same front end resources.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>exports</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>A {@link Err.Handler pretty error page}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>usage</h2>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   use(new Whoops());
 *
 *   get("/", req -> {
 *     throw new IllegalStateException("Something broken!");
 *   });
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The pretty error page handler is available in development mode:
 * <code>application.env = dev</code>
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>custom err pages</h2>
 * <p>
 * The pretty error page is implemented via {@link Router#err(Handler)}. You might run into troubles
 * if your application require custom error pages. On those cases you probably won't use this module
 * or if apply one of the following options:
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>whoops as last err handler</h3>
 * <p>
 * This option is useful if you have custom error pages on some specific exceptions:
 * </p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   err(NotFoundException.class, (req, rsp, err) -> {
 *    // custom not found
 *   });
 *
 *   err(AccessDeniedException.class, (req, rsp, err) -> {
 *    // custom access denied
 *   });
 *
 *   // not handled it use whoops
 *   use(new Whoops());
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * Here the custom error page for <code>NotFoundException</code> or
 * <code>AccessDeniedException</code> will be render before the <code>Whoops</code> error handler.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>whoops on dev</h3>
 * <p>
 * This options will active <code>Whoops</code> in <code>dev</code> and the custom err pages in
 * <code>prod-like</code> environments:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   on("dev", () -> {
 *     use(new Whoops());
 *   })
 *   .orElse(() -> {
 *     err((req, rsp, err) -> {
 *       // custom not found
 *     });
 *   });
 * }
 * }</pre>
