 *       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
 *       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
 *       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

 *       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 *       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

 *           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
 *           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 *           the Derivative Works; and
 *

 *           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 *           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 *           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 *           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 *           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 *           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

 *           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 *           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 *           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 *           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 *           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 *           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 *           as modifying the License.
 *
 *       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 *       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 *    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 *       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 *       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *
 *    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 *       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 *       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 *       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 *       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 *       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 *
 *    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 *
 *    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 *
 *    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
 *
 *       To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following

/**
 * <h1>metrics</h1>
 * <p>
 * Metrics provides a powerful toolkit of ways to measure the behavior of critical components in
 * your production environment.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>usage</h2>
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   use(new Metrics()
 *      .request()
 *      .threadDump()
 *      .ping()
 *      .healthCheck("db", new DatabaseHealthCheck())
 *      .metric("memory", new MemoryUsageGaugeSet())
 *      .metric("threads", new ThreadStatesGaugeSet())
 *      .metric("gc", new GarbageCollectorMetricSet())
 *      .metric("fs", new FileDescriptorRatioGauge())
 *      );
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Let's see what all these means.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>metrics</h2>
 * <p>
 * Metrics are available at <code>/sys/metrics</code> or <code>/sys/metrics/:type</code> via:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *   use(new Metrics()
 *      .metric("memory", new MemoryUsageGaugeSet())
 *      .metric("threads", new ThreadStatesGaugeSet())
 *      .metric("gc", new GarbageCollectorMetricSet())
 *      .metric("fs", new FileDescriptorRatioGauge()));
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The <code>/:type</code> parameter is optional and let you filter metrics by type
 * <code>counters</code>, <code>guages</code>, etc..
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There is a <code>name</code> filter too: <code>/sys/metrics?name=memory</code> or
 * <code>/sys/metrics/guages?name=memory</code>. The <code>name</code> parameter filter all the
 * metrics where the name starts with the given <code>name</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>health checks</h2>
 * <p>
 * Health checks are available at <code>/sys/healthCheck</code> via:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *   use(new Metrics()
 *      .healthCheck("db", new DatabaseHealthCheck()));
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>instrumented requests</h2>
 * <p>
 * Captures request information (like active requests or min/mean/max execution time) and a
 * breakdown of the response codes being returned: {@link InstrumentedHandler}.
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *   use(new Metrics()
 *      .request());
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>thread dump</h2>
 * <p>
 * A thread dump is available at <code>/sys/threadDump</code> via:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *   use(new Metrics()
 *      .threadDump());
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>reporting</h2>
 * <p>
 * Reporters are appended via a callback API:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *   {
 *     use(new Metrics()
 *        .reporter(registry {@literal ->} {
 *          ConsoleReporter reporter = ConsoleReporter.forRegistry(registry).build();
 *          reporter.start(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
 *          return reporter;
 *        });
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * You can add all the reporters you want. Keep in mind you have to start them (if need it), but you
 * don't have to stop them as long they implements the {@link Closeable} interface.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * That's all folks!
 * </p>
