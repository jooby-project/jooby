 *       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
 *       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
 *       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
 *       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
 *       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
 *       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

 *           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 *           the Derivative Works; and
 *
 *       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
 *           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

 *           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 *           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 *           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 *           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

 *           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 *           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents

 *           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 *           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 *           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 *           as modifying the License.
 *
 *       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 *       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 *    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 *       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 *       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *
 *    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 *       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 *       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 *       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 *       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 *       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 *
 *    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 *
 *    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 *
 *    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
 *
 *       To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
 *       boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"

/**
 * <h1>svg-symbol</h1>
 * <p>
 * SVG <code>symbol</code> for icons: merge svg files from a folder and generates a
 * <code>sprite.svg</code> and <code>sprite.css</code> files.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>usage</h2>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * assets {
 *   fileset {
 *     sprite: svg-symbol
 *   }
 *
 *   svg-symbol {
 *     input: "images/svg"
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Previous example looks for <code>*.svg</code> files inside the <code>images/svg</code> folder and
 * generate a <code>sprite.svg</code> and <code>sprite.css</code> files.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * You can display the svg icons using id reference:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * <svg>
 *   <use xlink:href="#approved" />
 * </svg>
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * This technique is described here:
 * <a href="https://css-tricks.com/svg-symbol-good-choice-icons">SVG symbol a Good Choice for
 * Icons</a>
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>options</h2>
 *
 * <h3>output</h3>
 * <p>
 * Defines where to write the <code>svg</code> and <code>css</code> files. Default value is:
 * <code>sprite</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * svg-symbol {
 *   output: "folder/symbols"
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * There are two more specific output options: <code>svg.output</code> and <code>css.output</code>
 * if any of these options are present the <code>output</code> option is ignored:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * svg-symbol {
 *   css {
 *     output: "css/sprite.css"
 *   },
 *   svg {
 *     output: "img/sprite.svg"
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h3>id prefix and suffix</h3>
 * <p>
 * ID is generated from <code>svg file names</code>. These options prepend or append something to
 * the generated id.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * svg-symbol {
 *   output: "sprite"
 *   id {
 *     prefix: "icon-"
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Generates IDs like: <code>icon-approved</code>, while:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * svg-symbol {
 *   output: "sprite"
 *   id {
 *     suffix: "-icon"
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Generates IDs like: <code>approved-icon</code>
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>css prefix</h3>
 * <p>
 * Prepend a string to a generated css class. Here is the css class for <code>approved.svg</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * .approved {
 *   width: 18px;
 *   height: 18px;
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If we set a <code>svg</code> css prefix:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   svg-symbol: {
 *     css {
 *       prefix: "svg"
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The generated css class will be:
 * <pre>{@code
 * svg.approved {
 *   width: 18px;
 *   height: 18px;
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * This option is useful for generating more specific css class selectors.
 * </p>
