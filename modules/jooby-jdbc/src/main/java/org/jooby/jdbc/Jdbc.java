 *       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify

 *       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

 *
 *    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

/**
 * <h1>jdbc</h1>
 * <p>
 * Production-ready jdbc data source, powered by the
 * <a href="https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP">HikariCP</a> library.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>usage</h2>
 *
 * Via connection string:
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   use(new Jdbc("jdbc:mysql://localhost/db"));
 *
 *   // accessing to the data source
 *   get("/my-api", (req, rsp) {@literal ->} {
 *     DataSource db = req.getInstance(DataSource.class);
 *     // do something with datasource
 *   });
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Via <code>db</code> property:
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   use(new Jdbc("db"));
 *
 *   // accessing to the data source
 *   get("/my-api", (req, rsp) {@literal ->} {
 *     DataSource db = req.getInstance(DataSource.class);
 *     // do something with datasource
 *   });
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>db configuration</h2>
 * <p>
 * Database configuration is controlled from your <code>application.conf</code> file using the
 * <code>db</code> property and friends: <code>db.*</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>mem db</h3>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   db = mem
 * </pre>
 *
 * Mem db is implemented with <a href="http://www.h2database.com/">h2 database</a>, before using it
 * make sure to add the h2 dependency to your <code>pom.xml</code>:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   &lt;dependency&gt;
 *     &lt;groupId&gt;com.h2database&lt;/groupId&gt;
 *     &lt;artifactId&gt;h2&lt;/artifactId&gt;
 *   &lt;/dependency&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * Mem db is useful for dev environment and/or transient data that can be regenerated.
 *
 * <h3>fs db</h3>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   db = fs
 * </pre>
 *
 * File system db is implemented with <a href="http://www.h2database.com/">h2 database</a>, before
 * using it make sure to add the h2 dependency to your ```pom.xml```:
 *
 * File system db is useful for dev environment and/or transient data that can be
 * regenerated. Keep in mind this db is saved in a tmp directory and db will be deleted it
 * on restarts.
 *
 * <h3>db.url</h3>
 * <p>
 * Connect to a database using a jdbc url, some examples here:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   # mysql
 *   db.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydb
 *   db.user=myuser
 *   db.password=password
 * </pre>
 *
 * Previous example, show you how to connect to <strong>mysql</strong>, setting user and password.
 * But of course you need the jdbc driver on your <code>pom.xml</code>:
 *
 * <h3>hikari configuration</h3>
 * <p>
 * If you need to configure or tweak the <a
 * href="https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP">hikari pool</a> just add <code>hikari.*</code>
 * entries to your <code>application.conf</code> file:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   db.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydb
 *   db.user=myuser
 *   db.password=password
 *   db.cachePrepStmts=true
 *
 *   # hikari
 *   hikari.autoCommit = true
 *   hikari.maximumPoolSize = 20
 *   # etc...
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Also, all the <code>db.*</code> properties are converted to <code>dataSource.*</code> to let <a
 * href="https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP">hikari</a> configure the target jdbc
 * connection.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>multiple connections</h2>
 * It is pretty simple to configure two or more db connections.
 *
 * Let's suppose we have a main database and an audit database for tracking changes:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   use(new Jdbc("db.main")); // main database
 *   use(new Jdbc("db.audit")); // audit database
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * application.conf:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * # main database
 * db.main.url = ...
 * db.main.user=...
 * db.main.password = ...
 *
 * # audit
 * db.audit.url = ....
 * db.audit.user = ....
 * db.audit.password = ....
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Same principle applies if you need to tweak hikari:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * # max pool size for main db
 * hikari.main.maximumPoolSize = 100
 *
 * # max pool size for audit db
 * hikari.audit.maximumPoolSize = 20
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Finally, if you need to inject the audit data source, all you have to do is to use the
 * <strong>Name</strong> annotation, like <code>@Name("db.audit")</code>
 * </p>
 *
 *
 * That's all folks! Enjoy it!!!
