 *           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 *           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 *           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

 *       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 *    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 *       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 *       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *
 *    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 *       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 *       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 *       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 *       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 *       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

 *       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

 *       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

/**
 * <h1>API doc</h1>
 * <p>
 *  Automatically export your HTTP API to open standards like
 *  <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> and <a href="https://raml.org/">RAML</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   Writing documentation in general is a hard and tedious task and once done it doesn't end
 *   there. You also need to keep it synchronize every time you change something.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   This module generates live documentation from your HTTP API, every new change is automatically
 *   reflected keeping documentation up-to-date with no extra effort.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>usage</h2>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *    use(new ApiTool()
 *      .swagger("/swagger")
 *      .raml("/raml")
 *    );
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 *   Those lines export your API to <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> and
 *   <a href="https://raml.org/">RAML</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   Swagger UI will be available at <code>/swagger</code> path while the definition file
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>example</h2>
 * <p>Suppose you have a <code>Pet API</code> like:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   /**
 *     * Everything about your Pets.
 *     *&#47;
 *   use("/api/pets")
 *     /**
 *       * List pets ordered by name.
 *       *
 *       * @param start Start offset, useful for paging. Default is <code>0</code>.
 *       * @param max Max page size, useful for paging. Default is <code>200</code>.
 *       * @return Pets ordered by name.
 *       *&#47;
 *      .get(req {@literal ->} {
 *        int start = req.param("start").intValue(0);
 *        int max = req.param("max").intValue(200);
 *        DB db = req.require(DB.class);
 *        List&lt;Pet&gt; pets = db.findAll(Pet.class, start, max);
 *        return pets;
 *      })
 *     /**
 *       * Find pet by ID
 *       *
 *       * @param id Pet ID.
 *       * @return Returns <code>200</code> with a single pet or <code>404</code>
 *       *&#47;
 *       .get("/:id",req {@literal ->} {
 *         int id = req.param("id").intValue();
 *         DB db = req.require(DB.class);
 *         Pet pet = db.find(Pet.class,id);
 *         return pet;
 *       })
 *     /**
 *       * Add a new pet to the store.
 *       *
 *       * @param body Pet object that needs to be added to the store.
 *       * @return Returns a saved pet.
 *       *&#47;
 *       .post(req {@literal ->} {
 *         Pet pet = req.body().to(Pet.class);
 *         DB db = req.require(DB.class);
 *         db.save(pet);
 *         return pet;

 *       *&#47;
 *       .put(req {@literal ->} {
 *         Pet pet = req.body().to(Pet.class);
 *         DB db = req.require(DB.class);db.save(pet);
 *         return pet;
 *       })
 *     /**

 *         return Results.noContent();
 *       })
 *       .produces("json")
 *       .consumes("json");
 *
 *    /**
 *     * Install API Doc and export your HTTP API:
 *     *&#47;
 *    use(new ApiTool()
 *      .swagger("/swagger")
 *      .raml("/raml")
 *    );
 *
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 *   Write your <code>API</code> and the <code>ApiTool</code> module automatically
 *   export it to <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> and <a href="https://raml.org/">RAML</a>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *   Works for <code>MVC routes</code> and <a href="http://jooby.org/doc/lang-kotlin">Kotlin</a>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>keep documentation</h2>
 * <p>
 *   The {@link ApiTool} module parse documentation from source code. It works well as long as the
 *   source code is present, but it won't work once deployed it.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   To fix this we do provide a <a href="https://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> and
 *   <a href="https://gradle.org">Gradle</a> tasks that process your API at build time and keep the
 *   documentation available for later usage.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>maven plugin</h3>
 * <p>Go to the <code>plugins</code> section of your <code>pom.xml</code> and add these lines:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * <plugin>
 *   <groupId>org.jooby</groupId>
 *   <artifactId>jooby-maven-plugin</artifactId>
 *   <executions>
 *     <execution>
 *       <goals>
 *         <goal>apitool</goal>
 *       </goals>
 *     </execution>
 *   </executions>
 * </plugin>
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 *   Now, compile your application the <code>apitool</code> plugin will generates a
 *   <code>.json</code> file for your API.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>gradle task</h3>
 * <p>
 *   Go to <code>build.gradle</code> and add these lines:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * buildscript {
 *     dependencies {
 *         classpath group: 'org.jooby', name: 'jooby-gradle-plugin', version: '1.1.3'
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * apply plugin: 'jooby'
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Then run:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   joobyApiTool
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>options</h2>
 * <p>
 *   There are a couple of options that control what is exposed as well as how do we export.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>filter</h3>
 * <p>
 *   The <code>filter</code> option control what routes are exported.
 * </p>
 * <pre>{@code
 *  {
 *
 *    use(new ApiTool()
 *        // Keep /api/* routes:
 *       .filter(route -> route.pattern().startWiths("/api/")
 *    );
 *  }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h3>disable try it</h3>
 * <p>
 *   Disable the <code>tryIt</code> button in <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> or <a href="https://raml.org/">RAML</a>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *  {
 *    use(new ApiTool()
 *       .disableTryIt()
 *    );
 *  }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h3>disable UI</h3>
 * <p>
 *   Disable <code>UI</code> for <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> or <a href="https://raml.org/">RAML</a>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *  {
 *    use(new ApiTool()
 *       .disableUI()
 *    );
 *  }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h3>theme</h3>
 * <p>
 *   Set the default theme for <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> or <a href="https://raml.org/">RAML</a>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *  {
 *    use(new ApiTool()
 *       .raml(
 *          new Options("/raml")
 *            .theme("dark")
 *       )
 *       .swagger(
 *          new Options("/swagger")
 *            .theme("muted")
 *       )
 *    );
 *  }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 *   Themes can set at runtime too via <code>theme</code> query parameter:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   /swagger?theme=material
 *
 *   /raml?theme=dark
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 *   Complete list of <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> theme are available <a href="https://github.com/ostranme/swagger-ui-themes">here</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   Raml comes with only two themes: <code>light</code> and <code>dark</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>advanced usage</h2>
 * <p>
 *   Sometimes the {@link ApiTool} module doesn't generate correct metadata like type, names,
 *   documentation, etc. When that happens you need to manually fix/provide metadata.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *   {
 *     use(new ApiTool()
 *       .modify(r -> r.pattern().equals("/api/pet/{id}", route -> {
 *         // Fix java doc for id parameter
 *         route.param("id", param -> {
 *           param.description("Fixing doc for ID");
 *         });
 *
 *         // Set response type
 *         route.response()
 *           .type(Pet.class);
 *       });
 *     );
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 *   It is possible to customize Swagger/RAML objects:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *   {
 *     use(new ApiTool()
 *       .swagger(swagger -> {
 *         // Deal with Swagger API
 *         ...
 *       })
 *       .raml(raml -> {
 *         // Deal with Swagger API
 *         ...
 *       });
 *     );
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 *   This option is required when you want to customize/complement Swagger/RAML objects.
 * </p>
 *
 * @since 1.2.0
