  "readme": "# Lazy Streams\n\n> *Create streams lazily when they are read from or written to.*  \n> `lazystream: 1.0.0` [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jpommerening/node-lazystream.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jpommerening/node-lazystream)  \n\n## Why?\n\nSometimes you feel the itch to open *all the files* at once. You want to pass a bunch of streams around, so the consumer does not need to worry where the data comes from.\nFrom a software design point-of-view this sounds entirely reasonable. Then there is that neat little function `fs.createReadStream()` that opens a file and gives you a nice `fs.ReadStream` to pass around, so you use what the mighty creator deities of node bestowed upon you.\n\n> `Error: EMFILE, too many open files`  \n> ─ *node*\n\nThis package provides two classes based on the node's Streams3 API (courtesy of `readable-stream` to ensure a stable version).\n\n## Class: lazystream.Readable\n\nA wrapper for readable streams. Extends [`stream.PassThrough`](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_passthrough).\n\n### new lazystream.Readable(fn [, options])\n\n* `fn` *{Function}*  \n  The function that the lazy stream will call to obtain the stream to actually read from.\n* `options` *{Object}*  \n  Options for the underlying `PassThrough` stream, accessible by `fn`.\n\nCreates a new readable stream. Once the stream is accessed (for example when you call its `read()` method, or attach a `data`-event listener) the `fn` function is called with the outer `lazystream.Readable` instance bound to `this`.\n\nIf you pass an `options` object to the constuctor, you can access it in your `fn` function.\n\n```javascript\nnew lazystream.Readable(function (options) {\n  return fs.createReadStream('/dev/urandom');\n});\n```\n\n## Class: lazystream.Writable\n\nA wrapper for writable streams. Extends [`stream.PassThrough`](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_passthrough).\n\n### new lazystream.Writable(fn [, options])\n\n* `fn` *{Function}*  \n  The function that the lazy stream will call to obtain the stream to actually write to.\n* `options` *{Object}*  \n  Options for the underlying `PassThrough` stream, accessible by `fn`.\n\nCreates a new writable stream. Just like the one above but for writable streams.\n\n```javascript\nnew lazystream.Writable(function () {\n  return fs.createWriteStream('/dev/null');\n});\n```\n\n## Install\n\n```console\n$ npm install lazystream --save\nlazystream@1.0.0 node_modules/lazystream\n└── readable-stream@2.0.5\n```\n\n## Changelog\n\n### v1.0.0\n\n- [#2](https://github.com/jpommerening/node-lazystream/pull/2): [unconditionally](https://r.va.gg/2014/06/why-i-dont-use-nodes-core-stream-module.html) use `readable-stream` _2.x_.\n\n### v0.2.0\n\n- [#1](https://github.com/jpommerening/node-lazystream/pull/1): error events are now propagated\n\n### v0.1.0\n\n- _(this was the first release)_\n\n## Contributing\n\nFork it, branch it, send me a pull request. We'll work out the rest together.\n\n## Credits\n\n[Chris Talkington](https://github.com/ctalkington) and his [node-archiver](https://github.com/ctalkington/node-archiver) for providing a use-case.\n\n## [License](LICENSE-MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 J.
