 *       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

 *       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

/**
 * <h1>mongodb-rx</h1>
 * <p>
 * <a href="http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver-rx/">MongoDB RxJava Driver: </a> provides
 * composable asynchronous and event-based observable sequences for MongoDB.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A MongoDB based driver providing support for <a href="http://reactivex.io">ReactiveX (Reactive
 * Extensions)</a> by using the <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava">RxJava library</a>.
 * All database calls return an
 * <a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/observable.html">Observable</a> allowing for efficient
 * execution, concise code, and functional composition of results.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This module depends on {@link Rx} module, please read the {@link Rx} documentation before using
 * this module.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>exports</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link MongoClient}</li>
 * <li>{@link MongoDatabase} (when mongo connection string has a database)</li>
 * <li>{@link MongoCollection} (when mongo connection string has a collection)</li>
 * <li>{@link Route.Mapper} for mongo observables</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>depends on</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Rx rx module}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>usage</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 *
 * import org.jooby.mongodb.MongoRx;
 *
 * {
 *   // required by MongoRx
 *   use(new Rx());
 *
 *   use(new MongoRx());
 *
 *   get("/", req -> {
 *     MongoClient client = req.require(MongoClient.class);
 *     // work with client:
 *   });
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The <code>mongo-rx</code> module connects to <code>mongodb://localhost</code>. You can change the
 * connection string by setting the <code>db</code> property in your
 * <code>application.conf</code> file:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * db = "mongodb://localhost/mydb"
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Or at creation time:
 * </p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   // required by MongoRx
 *   use(new Rx());
 *
 *   use(new MongoRx("mongodb://localhost/mydb"));
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If your connection string has a database, then you can require a {@link MongoDatabase} object:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   // required by MongoRx
 *   use(new Rx());
 *
 *   use(new MongoRx("mongodb://localhost/mydb"));
 *
 *   get("/", req -> {
 *     MongoDatabase mydb = req.require(MongoDatabase.class);
 *     return mydb.listCollections();
 *   });
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * And if your connection string has a collection:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   // required by MongoRx
 *   use(new Rx());
 *
 *   use(new MongoRx("mongodb://localhost/mydb.mycol"));
 *
 *   get("/", req -> {
 *     MongoCollection mycol = req.require(MongoCollection.class);
 *     return mycol.find();
 *   });
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>query the collection</h2>
 * <p>
 * The module let you return {@link MongoObservable} directly as route responses:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   // required by MongoRx
 *   use(new Rx());
 *
 *   use(new MongoRx()
 *      .observableAdapter(observable -> observable.observeOn(Scheduler.io())));
 *
 *   get("/pets", req -> {
 *     MongoDatabase db = req.require(MongoDatabase.class);
 *     return db.getCollection("pets")
 *        .find();
 *   });
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Previous example will list all the <code>Pets</code> from a collection. Please note you don't
 * have to deal with {@link MongoObservable}, instead the module converts {@link MongoObservable} to
 * Jooby async semantics.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>multiple databases</h2>
 * <p>
 * Multiple databases are supported by adding multiple {@link MongoRx} instances to your
 * application:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   // required by MongoRx
 *   use(new Rx());
 *
 *   use(new MongoRx("db1"));
 *
 *   use(new MongoRx("db2"));
 *
 *   get("/do-with-db1", req -> {
 *     MongoDatabase db1 = req.require("db1", MongoDatabase.class);
 *   });
 *
 *   get("/do-with-db2", req -> {
 *     MongoDatabase db2 = req.require("db2", MongoDatabase.class);
 *   });
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * The keys <code>db1</code> and <code>db2</code> are connection strings in your
 * <code>application.conf</code>:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *   db1 = "mongodb://localhost/db1"
 *
 *   db2 = "mongodb://localhost/db2"
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>observable adapter</h2>
 * <p>
 * {@link ObservableAdapter} provides a simple way to adapt all Observables returned by the driver.
 * On such use case might be to use a different Scheduler after returning the results from MongoDB
 * therefore freeing up the connection thread.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   // required by MongoRx
 *   use(new Rx());
 *
 *   use(new MongoRx().observableAdapter(o -> o.observeOn(Schedulers.io())));
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Any computations on Observables returned by the {@link MongoDatabase} or {@link MongoCollection}
 * will use the IO scheduler, rather than blocking the MongoDB Connection thread.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Please note the {@link #observableAdapter(Function)} works if (and only if) your connection
 * string points to a database. It won't work on <code>mongo://localhost</code> connection string
 * because there is no database in it.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>driver options</h2>
 * <p>
 * Driver options are available via
 * <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.0/reference/connection-string/">connection string</a>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * It is also possible to configure specific options:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *
 * db = "mongodb://localhost/pets"
 *
 * mongo {
 *   readConcern: default
 *   writeConcern: ACKNOWLEDGED
 *   cluster {
 *     replicaSetName: name
 *     requiredClusterType: REPLICA_SET
 *   }
 *   pool {
 *     maxSize: 100
 *     minSize: 10
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each option matches a {@link MongoClientSettings} method.
 * </p>
