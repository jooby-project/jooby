 *       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
 *       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
 *       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
 *       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
 *       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
 *       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

 *    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 *       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 *       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 *       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

 *           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
 *           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 *           the Derivative Works; and
 *
 *       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
 *           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 *           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 *           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 *           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 *           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 *           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

 *           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 *           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 *           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 *           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 *           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 *           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 *           as modifying the License.
 *
 *       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 *       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 *    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 *       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 *       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *
 *    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 *       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 *       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 *       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 *       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 *       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 *
 *    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 *
 *    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 *
 *    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
 *
 *       To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
 *       boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"

 *       comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
 *       file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
 *       same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
 *       identification within third-party archives.

/**
 * <h1>jackson</h1>
 *
 * JSON support from the excellent <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson">Jackson</a>
 * library.
 *
 * This module provides a JSON {@link Parser} and {@link Renderer}, but also an
 * {@link ObjectMapper}.
 *
 * <h2>usage</h2>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   use(new Jackson());
 *
 *   // sending
 *   get("/my-api", req {@literal ->} new MyObject());
 *
 *   // receiving a json body
 *   post("/my-api", req {@literal ->} {
 *     MyObject obj = req.body(MyObject.class);
 *     return obj;
 *   });
 *
 *   // receiving a json param from a multipart or form url encoded
 *   post("/my-api", req {@literal ->} {
 *     MyObject obj = req.param("my-object").to(MyObject.class);
 *     return obj;
 *   });
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>views</h2>
 * <p>Dynamic views are supported via {@link JacksonView}:</p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   use(new Jackson());
 *
 *   get("/public", req -> {
 *     Item item = ...;
 *     return new JacksonView<>(Views.Public.class, item);
 *   });
 *
 *   get("/public", req -> {
 *     Item item = ...;
 *     return new JacksonView<>(Views.Internal.class, item);
 *   });
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>advanced configuration</h2>
 * <p>
 * If you need a special setting or configuration for your {@link ObjectMapper}:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   use(new Jackson().configure(mapper {@literal ->} {
 *     // setup your custom object mapper
 *   });
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * or provide an {@link ObjectMapper} instance:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   ObjectMapper mapper = ....;
 *   use(new Jackson(mapper));
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * It is possible to wire Jackson modules too:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *
 *   use(new Jackson()
 *      .module(MyJacksonModuleWiredByGuice.class)
 *   );
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * This is useful when your jackson module require some dependencies.
