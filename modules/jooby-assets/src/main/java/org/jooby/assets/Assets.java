/**
 * <h1>assets</h1>
 * <p>
 * The asset module is library to concatenate, minify or compress JavaScript and CSS
 * assets. It also adds the ability to write these assets in other languages and process/compile
 * them to another language. Finally, it help you to write high quality code by validate JavaScript
 * and CSS too.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A variety of processors are available (jshint, csslint, jscs, uglify, closure-compiler, etc..),
 * but
 * also you might want to write your owns.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>getting started</h2>
 * <p>
 * The first thing you need to do is to define your assets. Definition is done in your
 * <code>.conf</code> file or in a special file: <code>assets.conf</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <strong>assets.conf</strong>
 * <pre>
 * assets {
 *   fileset {
 *     home: [assets/home.js, assets/home.css]
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <strong>App.java</strong>
 * <pre>
 *  {
 *    use(new Assets());
 *  }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The assets module will publish 4 request local variables for <code>home</code> fileset:
 * <code>_css</code> and <code>_js</code> each of these variables is a list of string with the
 * corresponding files. There are two more variables: <code>_styles</code> and <code>_scripts</code>
 * :
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   &lt;html&gt;
 *   &lt;head&gt;
 *     {{{home_styles}}}
 *   &lt;body&gt;
 *     ...
 *     {{{home_scripts}}
 *   &lt;/body&gt;
 *   &lt;/head&gt;
 *   &lt;/html&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The variables: <code>_styles</code> and <code>_scripts</code> produces one ore more
 * <code>link</code> and <code>script</code> tags. The example above, shows you how to
 * render these variables in the template engine of your choice (handlebars, here).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Now, let's see how to configure the Maven plugin to process our assets at build-time:
 * </p>
 *
 * <strong>pom.xml</strong>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   &lt;plugin&gt;
 *     &lt;groupId&gt;org.jooby&lt;/groupId&gt;
 *     &lt;artifactId&gt;jooby-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
 *     &lt;executions&gt;
 *       &lt;execution&gt;
 *         &lt;goals&gt;
 *           &lt;goal&gt;assets&lt;/goal&gt;
 *         &lt;/goals&gt;
 *       &lt;/execution&gt;
 *     &lt;/executions&gt;
 *   &lt;/plugin&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The plugin will process all your assets and include them to the final <code>.jar</code>,
 * <code>.zip</code> or <code>.war</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Cool, isn't?
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>how it works?</h2>
 * <p>
 * The <code>assets.fileset</code> defines all your assets. In <code>dev</code> assets are
 * rendered/processed at runtime. In <code>prod</code> at built-time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Assets are rendered at runtime using <code>*_styles</code> or <code>*_scripts
 * </code> variables. So you define your assets in one single place: <code>assets.conf</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Also, at build-time, the asset compiler concatenates all the files from a fileset and
 * generate a fingerprint. The fingerprint is a SHA-1 hash of the content of the fileset. Thanks to
 * the fingerprint an asset can be cached it for ever! Defaults cache max age is:
 * <code>365 days</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * That isn't all! the <code>*_styles</code> and <code>*_scripts</code> are updated with the
 * fingerprint version of assets, so you don't have to do or change anything in your views! It just
 * works!!!
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>fileset</h2>
 * <p>
 * A fileset is a group of assets within a name. The fileset name is expanded into 4 request local
 * variables, for example:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * assets {
 *   fileset {
 *     home: [assets/home.js, assets/home.css]
 *     pageA: [assets/pageA.js, assets/pageA.css]
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Produces 4 variables for <code>home</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>home_css: a list of all the <code>css</code> files</li>
 * <li>home_styles: a string, with all the <code>css</code> files rendered as <code>link</code> tags
 * </li>
 * <li>home_js: a list of all the <code>js</code> files</li>
 * <li>home_scripts: a string, with all the <code>js</code> files rendered as <code>script</code>
 * tags</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Another 4 variables will be available for the <code>pageA</code> fileset!
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>extending filesets</h3>
 * <p>
 * Extension or re-use of filesets is possible via the: <code>&lt;</code> operator:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * assets {
 *   fileset {
 *     base: [js/lib/jquery.js, css/normalize.css]
 *     home &lt; base: [js/home.js]
 *     pageA &lt; base: [js/pageA.js]
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>processors</h2>
 * <p>
 * An {@link AssetProcessor} usually checks or modify an asset content in one way or another. They
 * are defined in the <code>assets.conf</code> files using the <code>pipeline</code> construction:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * assets {
 *   fileset {
 *     home: [js/home.js, css/home.css]
 *   }
 *
 *   pipeline {
 *     dev: [jshint, jscs, csslint, sass]
 *     dist: [uglify, sass, clean-css]
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Example above, defines a <strong>pipeline</strong> for development (dev) and one generic for prod
 * (dist).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In <code>dev</code> the code will be checked it against js-hint, jscs and csslint! But
 * also, we want to use sass for css!!
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The generic <code>dist</code> will be used it for any other environment and here we just want to
 * optimize our javascript code with uglify, compile sass to css and then optimize the css using
 * clean-css!!
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For more information about processor, have a look at the {@link AssetProcessor} doc.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>aggregators</h2>
 * <p>
 * Contributes new or dynamically generated content to a <code>fileset</code>. Content generated by
 * an aggregator might be processed by an {@link AssetProcessor}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>how to use it?</h3>
 * <p>
 * First thing to do is to add the dependency:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *   &lt;dependency&gt;
 *     &lt;groupId&gt;org.jooby&lt;/groupId&gt;
 *     &lt;artifactId&gt;jooby-assets-dr-svg-sprites&lt;/artifactId&gt;
 *     &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;
 *   &lt;/dependency&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Did you see the <strong>provided</strong> scope? We just need the aggregator for development,
 * because assets are processed at runtime. For <code>prod</code>, assets are processed at
 * built-time via Maven/Gradle plugin, so we don't need it. This also, helps to keep our
 * dependencies and the jar size small.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Now we have the dependency all we have to do is to add the <code>svg-sprites</code> aggregator to
 * a fileset:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * assets {
 *   fileset {
 *     home: [
 *       // 1) Add the aggregator to a fileset
 *       svg-sprites,
 *       css/style.css,
 *       js/app.js
 *     ]
 *   }
 *
 *   svg-sprites {
 *     // 2) The `css/sprite.css` file is part of the `home` fileset.
 *     spritePath: "css/sprite.css"
 *
 *     spriteElementPath: "images/svg",
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Here for example, the <code>svg-sprites</code> aggregator contributes the
 * <code>css/sprite.css</code> file to the <code>home</code> fileset. The fileset then looks like:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * assets {
 *   fileset {
 *     home: [
 *       css/sprite.css,
 *       css/style.css,
 *       js/app.js
 *     ]
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Replaces the aggregator name with one or more files from {@link AssetAggregator#fileset()}
 * method.
 * </p>
