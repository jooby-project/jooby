# asset-management

We do provide two modules for writing modern web applications:

- [assets](/doc/assets): a custom framework for validate, transform, concatenate and minify assets. Useful, for web application with simple asset management.  

- [frontend](/doc/frontend): install and run [node](https://nodejs.org) locally. Allow you to use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org), [grunt](https://gruntjs.com), etc.. as well as modern UI libraries like [react.js], [vue.js] ... useful for web application with complex asset management.
