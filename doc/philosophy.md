# do more, more easily

- **Simple** and **effective** programming model for building small and large scale web applications
- Built with **developer productivity** in mind
- Plain **Java DSL** for routes (no xml, or similar)
- **Reflection**, **annotations** and **dependency injection** are kept to a **minimum** and in some cases is completely optional
- **No classpath hell**, the default deployment model uses a normal JVM bootstrap
- Modules are easy to use and do as little as possible

{{jooby}} keeps it **simple** yet **powerful**.
