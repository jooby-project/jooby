# philosophy: do more, more easily

- Simple and effective programming model for building small and large scale web applications
- Build with developer productive in mind
- Plain Java DSL for routes (no xml, or similar)
- Reflection, annotations and dependency injection are keep to minimum and in some cases it is completely optional
- No classpath hell, default deployment model uses a normal JVM bootstrap
- Modules are easy to use and they do as less as possible


In one word? Jooby keeps it simple but yet powerful.
