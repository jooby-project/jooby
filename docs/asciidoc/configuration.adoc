== Configuration
Application configuration is based on https://github.com/lightbend/config[config] library. Configuration 
can by default be provided in either Java properties, JSON, and https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md[HOCON] files.

Jooby allows overriding any property via system properties or environment variables.

=== Environment

The application environment is available via the javadoc:Environment[Environment] class, which allows specifying one 
or many unique environment names.

The active environment names serve the purpose of allowing loading different configuration files
depending on the environment. Also, javadoc:Extension[] modules might configure application
services differently depending on the environment too. For example: turn on/off caches, reload files, etc.

.Initializing the Environment
[source, java, role = "primary"]
----
{
  Environment env = getEnvironment();
}
----

.Kotlin
[source, kotlin, role = "secondary"]
----
{
  val env = environment
}
----

The active environment names property is set in one of this way:

- As program argument: `java -jar myapp.jar application.env=foo,bar`; or just `java -jar myapp.jar foo,bar`

NOTE: This method works as long you start the application using one of the `runApp` methods

- As system property: `java -Dapplication.env=foo,bar -jar myapp.jar`

- As environment variable: `application.env=foo,bar`


The javadoc:Jooby[getEnvironment] loads the default environment. 

=== Default Environment

The default environment is available via javadoc:Environment[loadEnvironment, io.jooby.EnvironmentOptions] method.

This method search for an `application.conf` file in three location (first-listed are higher priority):

- `${user.dir}/conf`. This is a file system location, useful is you want to externalize configuration (outside of jar file)
- `${user.dir}`. This is a file system location, useful is you want to externalize configuration (outside of jar file)
- `classpath://` (root of classpath). No external configuration, configuration file lives inside the jar file

NOTE: We use `$user.dir` to reference `System.getProperty("user.dir")`. This system property is set
by the JVM at application startup time. It represent the current directory from where the JVM was
launch it.
 
.File system loading
[source,bash]
----
└── conf
    └── application.conf
└── myapp.jar
----

A call to:

[source]
----
  Environment env = getEnvironment();
----

Loads the `application.conf` from `conf` directory. You get the same thing if you 
move the `application.conf` to `myapp.jar` directory.

.Classpath loading
[source,bash]
----
└── myapp.jar
   └── application.conf (file inside jar)
----

WARNING: Jooby favors file system property loading over classpath property loading. So, if there 
is a property file either in the current directory or conf directory it hides the same file
available in the classpath.

=== Overrides

Property overrides is done in multiple ways (first-listed are higher priority):

- Program arguments
- System properties
- Environment variables
- Environment property file
- Property file

.application.conf
[source, properties]
----
foo = foo
----

.Property access
[source, java, role="primary"]
----
{
  Environment env = getEnvironment();                <1>
  Config conf = env.getConfig();             <2>
  System.out.println(conf.getString("foo")); <3>
}
----

.Kotlin
[source, kotlin, role="secondary"]
----
{
  val env = environment          <1>
  val conf = env.config          <2>
  println(conf.getString("foo")) <3>
}
----

<1> Get environment
<2> Get configuration
<3> Get `foo` property and prints `foo`

At runtime you can override properties using:

.Program argument
[source, bash]
----
java -jar myapp.jar foo=argument
----

Example prints: `argument`

.System property
[source, bash]
----
java -Dfoo=sysprop -jar myapp.jar
----

Prints: `syspro`

.Environment variable
[source, bash]
----
foo=envar java -jar myapp.jar
----

Prints: `envar`

If you have multiple properties to override, it is probably better to collect all them into a new file
and use active environment name to select them.

.Environment property file
[source, bash]
----
└── application.conf
└── application.prod.conf
----

.application.conf
[source, properties]
----
foo = foo
bar = devbar
----

.application.prod.conf
[source, properties]
----
bar = prodbar
----

.Run with `prod` environment
----
java -jar my.app application.env=prod
----

Or just
----
java -jar my.app prod
----

TIP: You only need to override the properties that changes between environment not all the properties.

The `application.conf` defines two properties : `foo` and `bar`, while the environment property file
defines only `bar`.

For Multiple environment activation you need to separate them with `,` (comma):

.Run with `prod` and `cloud` environment
----
 java -jar my.app application.env=prod,cloud
----

=== Custom environment

Custom configuration and environment are available too using:

- The javadoc:EnvironmentOptions[] class, or
- Direct instantiation of the javadoc:Environment[] class

.Environment options
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
{
  Environment env = setEnvironmentOptions(
    new EnvironmentOptions().setFilename("myapp.conf"));   <1>
  )
}
----

.Kotlin
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
{
  val env = environmentOptions {                   <1>
    filename = "myapp.conf"
  }
}
----

<1> Load `myapp.conf` using the loading and precedence mechanism described before

The javadoc:Jooby[setEnvironmentOptions, io.jooby.EnvironmentOptions] method loads, set and returns
the environment.

To skip/ignore Jooby loading and precedence mechanism, just instantiate and set the environment:

.Direct instantiation
[source,java,role="primary"]
----
{
  Config conf = ConfigFactory.load("myapp.conf");            <1>
  Environment env = new Environment(getClassLoader(), conf); <2>
  setEnvironment(env);                                       <3>
}
----

.Kotlin
[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
----
{
  val conf = ConfigFactory.load("myapp.conf")              <1>
  val env = Environment(classLoader, conf)                 <2>    
  environment = env                                        <3>
}
----

<1> Loads and parses configuration
<2> Create a new environment with configuration and (http://optionally[optionally]) active names
<3> Set environment on Jooby instance

IMPORTANT: Custom configuration is very flexible. You can reuse Jooby mechanism or provide your own.
The only thing to keep in mind is that environment setting must be done at very early stage, before
starting the application.

=== Logging

Jooby uses https://www.slf4j.org[Slf4j] for logging which give you some flexibility for choosing
the logging framework.

==== Logback

The https://logback.qos.ch/manual/index.html[Logback] is probably the first alternative for 
https://www.slf4j.org[Slf4j] due its natively implements the SLF4J API. Follow the next steps to use
logback in your project:

1) Add dependency

[dependency, artifactId="logback-classic"]

2) Creates a `logback.xml` file in the `conf` directory:

.logback.xml
[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>

  <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
    <encoder>
      <pattern>%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
    </encoder>
  </appender>

  <root level="INFO">
    <appender-ref ref="STDOUT" />
  </root>
</configuration>
----

That's all! https://www.slf4j.org[Slf4j] is going to redirect log message to logback.

==== Log4j2

The https://logging.apache.org/log4j[Log4j2] project is another good alternative for logging. Follow
the next steps to use logback in your project:

1) Add dependencies

[dependency, artifactId="log4j-slf4j-impl, log4j-core"]

2) Creates a `log4j.xml` file in the `conf` directory:

.log4j.xml
[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Configuration>
  <Appenders>
    <Console name="stdout">
      <PatternLayout pattern="%d [%t] %-5level: %msg%n%throwable" />
    </Console>
  </Appenders>
  <Loggers>
    <Root level="INFO" additivity="true">
      <AppenderRef ref="stdout" />
    </Root>
  </Loggers>
</Configuration>
----

All these extensions are considered valid: `.xml`, `.propertines`, `.yaml` and `.json`. As well as `log4j2` for file name.

==== Environment logging

Logging is integrated with the environment names. So it is possible to have a file name:

- `logback[.name].xml` (for loggback)
- `log4j[.name].xml` (for log4j2)

Jooby favors the environment specific logging configuration file over regular/normal logging configuration file.

.Example
[source, bash]
----
conf
└── logback.conf
└── logback.prod.conf
----

To use `logback.prod.conf`, start your application like:

`java -jar myapp.jar application.env=prod`

[IMPORTANT]
====
The logging configuration file per environment works as long you don't use *static* loggers
before application has been start it. The next example won't work:

[source, java]
----
public class App extends Jooby {
  private static final Logger log = ...
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    runApp(args, App::new);
  }
}
----

The `runApp` method is the one who configures the logging framework. Adding a static logger force
the logging framework to configure without taking care the environment setup.

There are a couple of solution is for this:

- use an instance logger
- use the getLog() method of Jooby
====

=== Application Properties

These are the application properties that Jooby uses:

[options="header"]
|===
|Property name | Description | Default value
|application.charset | Charset used by your application. Used by template engine, HTTP encoding/decoding, database driver, etc. | `UTF-8`
|application.env | The active <<configuration-environment, environment>> names. Use to identify `dev` vs `non-dev` application deployment. Jooby applies some optimizations for `non-dev`environments | `dev`
|application.lang | The languages your application supports. Used by `Context.locale()` | A single locale provided by `Locale.getDefault()`.
|application.logfile | The logging configuration file your application uses. You don't need to set this property, see <<configuration-logging, logging configuration>>. |
|application.package | The base package of your application. |
|application.pid | JVM process ID. | The native process ID assigned by the operating system.
|application.startupSummary | The level of information logged during startup. |
|application.tmpdir | Temporary directory used by your application. | `tmp`
|===

See javadoc:AvailableSettings[] for more details.
