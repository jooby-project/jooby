 *           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 *           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 *           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 *           as modifying the License.
 *
 *       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 *       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 *    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 *       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 *       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *
 *    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 *       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 *       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 *       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or

 *       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 *
 *    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

/**
 * <h1>WebSockets</h1> Creating web sockets is pretty straightforward:
 *
 * <pre>
 *  {
 *    ws("/", (ws) -> {
 *      // connected
 *      ws.onMessage(message -> {
 *        System.out.println(message.stringValue());
 *        ws.send("Message Received");
 *      });
 *      ws.send("Connected");
 *    });
 *  }
 * </pre>
 *
 * First thing you need to do is to register a new web socket in your App using the
 * {@link Jooby#ws(String, Handler)} method.
 * You can specify a path to listen for web socket connection. The path can be a static path or
 * a path pattern (like routes).
 *
 * On new connections the {@link WebSocket.Handler#connect(WebSocket)} will be executed from there
 * you can listen on {@link #onMessage(Callback)}, {@link #onClose(Callback)} or
 * {@link #onError(Callback)} events.
 *
 * Inside a handler you can send text or binary message.
 *
 * <h2>Data types</h2> If your web socket is suppose to send/received a specific data type, like:
 * <code>json</code> it is nice to define a consumes and produces types:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   ws("/", (ws) -> {
 *     ws.onMessage(message -> {
 *       // read as json
 *       MyObject object = message.to(MyObject.class);
 *     });
 *
 *     MyObject object = new MyObject();
 *     ws.send(object); // convert to text message using a json converter
 *   })
 *   .consumes(MediaType.json)
 *   .produces(MediaType.json);
 * </pre>
