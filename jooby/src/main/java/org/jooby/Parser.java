 *       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
 *       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
 *       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

 *           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
 *           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
 *           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 *           the Derivative Works; and
 *
 *       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
 *           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 *           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 *           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 *           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 *           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 *           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 *           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 *           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 *           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 *           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 *           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 *           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 *           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 *           as modifying the License.
 *
 *       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 *       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 *    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 *       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 *       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *
 *    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 *       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 *       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 *       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 *       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 *       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 *
 *    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 *
 *    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 *
 *    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
 *
 *       To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
 *       boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"

 * Parse a request param (path, query, form) or body to something else.
 *
 * <h1>Registering a parser</h1>
 * <p>
 * There are two ways of registering a parser:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Using the {@link Jooby#parser(Parser)} method</li>
 * <li>From a Guice module:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   Multibinder&lt;Parser&gt; pcb = Multibinder
        .newSetBinder(binder, Parser.class);
     pcb.addBinding().to(MyParser.class);
 * </pre>
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * Parsers are executed in the order they were registered. The first converter that resolved the
 * type: wins!.
 *
 * <h2>Built-in parsers</h2>
 * <p>
 * These are the built-in parsers:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Primitives and String: convert to int, double, char, string, etc...</li>
 * <li>Enums (case-sensitive)</li>
 * <li>{@link java.util.Date}: It parses a date using the <code>application.dateFormat</code>
 * property.</li>
 * <li>{@link java.time.LocalDate}: It parses a date using the <code>application.dateFormat</code>
 * property.</li>
 * <li>{@link java.util.Locale}</li>
 * <li>Classes with a static method: <code>valueOf</code></li>
 * <li>Classes with a static method: <code>fromName</code></li>
 * <li>Classes with a static method: <code>fromString</code></li>
 * <li>Classes with a public constructor with one <code>String</code> argument</li>
 * <li>It is an Optional&lt;T&gt;, List&lt;T&gt;, Set&lt;T&gt; or SortedSet&lt;T&gt; where T
 * satisfies one of previous rules</li>
 * </ol>

   * Overwrite the default bean parser with <code>empty/null</code> supports. The default bean
   * parser doesn't allow <code>null</code>, so if a parameter is optional you must declare it as
   * {@link Optional} otherwise parsing fails with a <code>404/500</code> status code.
   *
   * For example:
   * <pre>{@code
   *
   * public class Book {
   *
   *   public String title;
   *
   *   public Date releaseDate;
   *
   *   public String toString() {
   *     return title + ":" + releaseDate;
   *   }
   * }
   *
   * {
   *   parser(Parser.bean(true));
   *
   *   post("/", req -> {
   *     return req.params(Book.class).toString();
   *   });
   * }
   * }</pre>
   *
   * <p>
   * With <code>/?title=Title&amp;releaseDate=</code> prints <code>Title:null</code>.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * Now, same call with <code>lenient=false</code> results in <code>Bad Request: 400</code>
   * because <code>releaseDate</code> if required and isn't present in the HTTP request.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * This feature is useful while submitting forms.
   * </p>
   *
   * @param lenient Enabled null/empty supports while parsing HTTP params as Java Beans.
   * @return A new bean parser.
