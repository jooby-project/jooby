 *           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 *           the Derivative Works; and
 *
 *       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

 *           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 *           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 *           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 *           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

 *           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 *           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 *           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

 *       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 *    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

 *       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *
 *    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 *       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

 *       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

 *
 *    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

/**
 * <h1>tests</h1>
 * <p>
 * In this section we are going to see how to run unit and integration tests in Jooby.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>unit tests</h2>
 * <p>
 * We do offer two programming models:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>script programming model; and</li>
 * <li>mvc programming model</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * You don't need much for <code>MVC</code> routes, because a route got binded to a method of some
 * class. So it is usually very easy and simple to mock and run unit tests against a
 * <code>MVC</code> route.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * We can't say the same for <code>script</code> routes, because a route is represented by a
 * <code>lambda</code> and there is no easy or simple way to get access to the lambda object.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * We do provide a {@link MockRouter} which simplify unit tests for <code>script routes</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>usage</h3>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class MyApp extends Jooby {
 *   {
 *     get("/test", () -> "Hello unit tests!");
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * A unit test for this route, looks like:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Test
 * public void simpleTest() {
 *   String result = new MockRouter(new MyApp())
 *      .get("/test");
 *   assertEquals("Hello unit tests!", result);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Just create a new instance of {@link MockRouter} with your application and call one of the HTTP
 * method, like <code>get</code>, <code>post</code>, etc...
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>mocks</h3>
 * <p>
 * You're free to choose the mock library of your choice. Here is an example using
 * <a href="http://easymock.org">EasyMock</a>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   get("/mock", req -> {
 *     return req.path();
 *   });
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * A test with <a href="http://easymock.org">EasyMock</a> looks like:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *
 * &#64;Test
 * public void shouldGetRequestPath() {
 *   Request req = EasyMock.createMock(Request.class);
 *   expect(req.path()).andReturn("/mypath");
 *
 *   EasyMock.replay(req);
 *
 *   String result = new MockRouter(new MyApp(), req)
 *      .get("/mock");
 *
 *   assertEquals("/mypath", result);
 *
 *   EasyMock.verify(req);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * You can mock a {@link Response} object in the same way:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   get("/mock", (req, rsp) -> {
 *     rsp.send("OK");
 *   });
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * A test with <a href="http://easymock.org">EasyMock</a> looks like:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *
 * &#64;Test
 * public void shouldUseResponseSend() {
 *   Request req = EasyMock.createMock(Request.class);
 *   Response rsp = EasyMock.createMock(Response.class);
 *   rsp.send("OK");
 *
 *   EasyMock.replay(req, rsp);
 *
 *   String result = new MockRouter(new MyApp(), req, rsp)
 *      .get("/mock");
 *
 *   assertEquals("OK", result);
 *
 *   EasyMock.verify(req, rsp);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * What about external dependencies? It works in a similar way:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   get("/", () -> {
 *     HelloService service = require(HelloService.class);
 *     return service.salute();
 *   });
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Test
 * public void shouldMockExternalDependencies() {
 *   HelloService service = EasyMock.createMock(HelloService.class);
 *   expect(service.salute()).andReturn("Hola!");
 *
 *   EasyMock.replay(service);
 *
 *   String result = new MockRouter(new MyApp())
 *      .set(service)
 *      .get("/");
 *
 *   assertEquals("Hola!", result);
 *
 *   EasyMock.verify(service);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link #set(Object)} call push and register an external dependency (usually a mock). This
 * make it possible to resolve services from <code>require</code> calls.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>deferred</h3>
 * <p>
 * Mock of promises are possible too:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   get("/", promise(deferred -> {
 *     deferred.resolve("OK");
 *   }));
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Test
 * public void shouldMockPromises() {
 *
 *   String result = new MockRouter(new MyApp())
 *      .get("/");
 *
 *   assertEquals("OK", result);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Previous test works for deferred routes:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   get("/", deferred(() -> {
 *     return "OK";
 *   }));
 * }
 * }</pre>
