 *
 *       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
 *       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
 *       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

 *       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 *       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

 *       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
 *       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
 *       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
 *       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 *       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
 *       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
 *       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 *       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
 *       as of the date such litigation is filed.
 *
 *    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
 *       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
 *       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
 *       meet the following conditions:
 *
 *       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
 *           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 *
 *       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
 *           stating that You changed the files; and
 *
 *       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
 *           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
 *           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
 *           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 *           the Derivative Works; and
 *
 *       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
 *           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 *           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 *           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 *           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 *           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 *           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 *           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 *           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 *           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 *           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 *           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 *           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 *           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 *           as modifying the License.
 *
 *       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 *       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 *    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 *       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 *       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *
 *    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 *       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 *       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 *       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 *       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 *       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 *
 *    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 *
 *    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

/**
 * <h1>jooby</h1>
 * <h2>getting started</h2>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class MyApp extends Jooby {
 *
 *   {
 *      use(new Jackson()); // 1. JSON serializer.
 *
 *      // 2. Define a route
 *      get("/", req {@literal ->} {
 *        Map{@literal <}String, Object{@literal >} model = ...;
 *        return model;
 *      }
 *   }
 *
 *  public static void main(String[] args) {
 *    run(MyApp::new, args); // 3. Done!
 *  }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>application.conf</h2>
 * <p>
 * Jooby delegate configuration management to <a
 * href="https://github.com/typesafehub/config">TypeSafe Config</a>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * By default Jooby looks for an <code>application.conf</code>. If
 * you want to specify a different file or location, you can do it with {@link #conf(String)}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/config">TypeSafe Config</a> uses a hierarchical model to
 * define and override properties.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A {@link Jooby.Module} might provides his own set of properties through the
 * {@link Jooby.Module#config()} method. By default, this method returns an empty config object.
 * </p>
 * For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   use(new M1());
 *   use(new M2());
 *   use(new M3());
 * </pre>
 *
 * Previous example had the following order (first-listed are higher priority):
 * <ul>
 * <li>arguments properties</li>
 * <li>System properties</li>
 * <li>application.conf</li>
 * <li>M3 properties</li>
 * <li>M2 properties</li>
 * <li>M1 properties</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Command line argmuents or system properties takes precedence over any application specific
 * property.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>env</h2>
 * <p>
 * Jooby defines one mode or environment: <strong>dev</strong>. In Jooby, <strong>dev</strong>
 * is special and some modules could apply special settings while running in <strong>dev</strong>.
 * Any other env is usually considered a <code>prod</code> like env. But that depends on module
 * implementor.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An <code>environment</code> can be defined in your <code>.conf</code> file using the
 * <code>application.env</code> property. If missing, Jooby set the <code>env</code> for you to
 * <strong>dev</strong>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There is more at {@link Env} please read the {@link Env} javadoc.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>modules: the jump to full-stack framework</h2>
 * <p>
 * {@link Jooby.Module Modules} are quite similar to a Guice modules except that the configure
 * callback has been complementing with {@link Env} and {@link Config}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   public class MyModule implements Jooby.Module {
 *     public void configure(Env env, Config config, Binder binder) {
 *     }
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * From the configure callback you can bind your services as you usually do in a Guice app.
 * <p>
 * There is more at {@link Jooby.Module} so please read the {@link Jooby.Module} javadoc.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>path patterns</h2>
 * <p>
 * Jooby supports Ant-style path patterns:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Some examples:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code com/t?st.html} - matches {@code com/test.html} but also {@code com/tast.html} or
 * {@code com/txst.html}</li>
 * <li>{@code com/*.html} - matches all {@code .html} files in the {@code com} directory</li>
 * <li><code>com/{@literal **}/test.html</code> - matches all {@code test.html} files underneath the
 * {@code com} path</li>
 * <li>{@code **}/{@code *} - matches any path at any level.</li>
 * <li>{@code *} - matches any path at any level, shorthand for {@code **}/{@code *}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>variables</h3>
 * <p>
 * Jooby supports path parameters too:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Some examples:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><code> /user/{id}</code> - /user/* and give you access to the <code>id</code> var.</li>
 * <li><code> /user/:id</code> - /user/* and give you access to the <code>id</code> var.</li>
 * <li><code> /user/{id:\\d+}</code> - /user/[digits] and give you access to the numeric
 * <code>id</code> var.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>routes</h2>
 * <p>
 * Routes perform actions in response to a server HTTP request.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Routes are executed in the order they are defined, for example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   get("/", (req, rsp) {@literal ->} {
 *     log.info("first"); // start here and go to second
 *   });
 *
 *   get("/", (req, rsp) {@literal ->} {
 *     log.info("second"); // execute after first and go to final
 *   });
 *
 *   get("/", (req, rsp) {@literal ->} {
 *     rsp.send("final"); // done!
 *   });
 * </pre>
 *
 * Previous example can be rewritten using {@link Route.Filter}:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   get("/", (req, rsp, chain) {@literal ->} {
 *     log.info("first"); // start here and go to second
 *     chain.next(req, rsp);
 *   });
 *
 *   get("/", (req, rsp, chain) {@literal ->} {
 *     log.info("second"); // execute after first and go to final
 *     chain.next(req, rsp);
 *   });
 *
 *   get("/", (req, rsp) {@literal ->} {
 *     rsp.send("final"); // done!
 *   });
 * </pre>
 *
 * Due to the use of lambdas a route is a singleton and you should NOT use global variables. For
 * example this is a bad practice:
 *
 * <pre>
 *  List{@literal <}String{@literal >} names = new ArrayList{@literal <}{@literal >}(); // names produces side effects
 *  get("/", (req, rsp) {@literal ->} {
 *     names.add(req.param("name").value();
 *     // response will be different between calls.
 *     rsp.send(names);
 *   });
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>mvc routes</h3>
 * <p>
 * A Mvc route use annotations to define routes:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   use(MyRoute.class);
 *   ...
 *
 *   // MyRoute.java
 *   {@literal @}Path("/")
 *   public class MyRoute {
 *
 *    {@literal @}GET
 *    public String hello() {
 *      return "Hello Jooby";
 *    }
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Programming model is quite similar to JAX-RS/Jersey with some minor differences and/or
 * simplifications.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To learn more about Mvc Routes, please check {@link org.jooby.mvc.Path},
 * {@link org.jooby.mvc.Produces} {@link org.jooby.mvc.Consumes} javadoc.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>static files</h2>
 * <p>
 * Static files, like: *.js, *.css, ..., etc... can be served with:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   assets("assets/**");
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Classpath resources under the <code>/assets</code> folder will be accessible from client/browser.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>lifecyle</h2>
 * <p>
 * We do provide {@link #onStart(Throwing.Consumer)} and {@link #onStop(Throwing.Consumer)} callbacks.
 * These callbacks are executed are application startup or shutdown time:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   onStart(() -> {
 *     log.info("Welcome!");
 *   });
 *
 *   onStop(() -> {
 *     log.info("Bye!");
 *   });
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * From life cycle callbacks you can access to application services:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   onStart(registry -> {
 *     MyDatabase db = registry.require(MyDatabase.class);
 *     // do something with databse:
 *   });
 * }
 * }</pre>

   * path or a classpath resource.

   * <p>
   * Optionally, you can set these too:
   * </p>
   *
   * <ul>
   * <li>
   * <code>ssl.keystore.password</code>: Password of the keystore.key (if any). Default is:
   * null/empty.
   * </li>
   * <li>
   * <code>ssl.trust.cert</code>: Trusted certificates for verifying the remote endpoint’s
   * certificate. The file should contain an X.509 certificate chain in PEM format. Default uses the
   * system default.
   * </li>
   * <li>
   * <code>ssl.session.cacheSize</code>: Set the size of the cache used for storing SSL session
   * objects. 0 to use the default value.
   * </li>
   * <li>
   * <code>ssl.session.timeout</code>: Timeout for the cached SSL session objects, in seconds. 0 to
   * use the default value.
   * </li>
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>
   * As you can see setup is very simple. All you need is your <code>.crt</code> and
