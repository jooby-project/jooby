 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

 *       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

/**
 * <p>
 * Sessions are created on demand via: {@link Request#session()}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Sessions have a lot of uses cases but most commons are: auth, store information about current
 * user, etc.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A session attribute must be {@link String} or a primitive. Session doesn't allow to store
 * arbitrary objects. It is a simple mechanism to store basic data.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h1>Session configuration</h1>
 *
 * <h2>No timeout</h2>
 * <p>
 * There is no timeout for sessions from server perspective. By default, a session will expire when
 * the user close the browser (a.k.a session cookie).
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Session store</h2>
 * <p>
 * A {@link Session.Store} is responsible for saving session data. Sessions are kept in memory, by
 * default using the {@link Session.Mem} store, which is useful for development, but wont scale well
 * on production environments. An redis, memcached, ehcache store will be a better option.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Store life-cycle</h3>
 * <p>
 * Sessions are persisted every time a request exit, if they are dirty. A session get dirty if an
 * attribute is added or removed from it.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>session.saveInterval</code> property indicates how frequently a session will be
 * persisted (in millis).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In short, a session is persisted when: 1) it is dirty; or 2) save interval has expired it.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h1>Cookie configuration</h1>
 * <p>
 * Next session describe the most important options:
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>max-age</h2>
 * <p>
 * The <code>session.cookie.maxAge</code> sets the maximum age in seconds. A positive value
 * indicates that the cookie will expire after that many seconds have passed. Note that the value is
 * the <i>maximum</i> age when the cookie will expire, not the cookie's current age.
 *
 * A negative value means that the cookie is not stored persistently and will be deleted when the
 * Web browser exits.
 *
 * Default maxAge is: <code>-1</code>.
 *
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>signed cookie</h2>
 * <p>
 * If the <code>application.secret</code> property has been set, then the session cookie will be
 * signed it with it.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>cookie's name</h2>
 * <p>
 * The <code>session.cookie.name</code> indicates the name of the cookie that hold the session ID,
 * by defaults: <code>jooby.sid</code>. Cookie's name can be explicitly set with
 * {@link Cookie.Definition#name(String)} on {@link Session.Definition#cookie()}.
 * </p>
