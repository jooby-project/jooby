 *       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
 *       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
 *       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
 *       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

 *       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
 *       as of the date such litigation is filed.
 *
 *    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

 *           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
 *           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 *           the Derivative Works; and
 *
 *       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
 *           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 *           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 *           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 *           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 *           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 *           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

 *           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 *           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents

 *           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 *           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 *           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 *           as modifying the License.
 *
 *       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 *       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 *    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 *       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 *       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *
 *    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 *       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 *       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 *       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 *       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 *       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 *
 *    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 *
 *    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 *
 *    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

/**
 * <h1>request logger</h1>
 * <p>
 * Log all the matched incoming requested using the
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format">NCSA format</a> (a.k.a common log
 * format).
 * </p>
 * <h2>usage</h2>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   use("*", new RequestLog());
 *
 *   ...
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Output looks like:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * 127.0.0.1 - - [04/Oct/2016:17:51:42 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 2
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * You probably want to configure the <code>RequestLog</code> logger to save output into a new file:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &lt;appender name="ACCESS" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender"&gt;
 *   &lt;file&gt;access.log&lt;/file&gt;
 *   &lt;rollingPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.TimeBasedRollingPolicy"&gt;
 *     &lt;fileNamePattern&gt;access.%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.log&lt;/fileNamePattern&gt;
 *   &lt;/rollingPolicy&gt;
 *
 *   &lt;encoder&gt;
 *     &lt;pattern&gt;%msg%n&lt;/pattern&gt;
 *   &lt;/encoder&gt;
 * &lt;/appender&gt;
 *
 * &lt;logger name="org.jooby.RequestLogger" additivity="false"&gt;
 *   &lt;appender-ref ref="ACCESS" /&gt;
 * &lt;/logger&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Due that authentication is provided via module or custom filter, there is no concept of
 * logged/authenticated user. Still you can log the current user by setting an user id provider at
 * construction time:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *
 *   use("*", (req, rsp) -> {
 *     // authenticate user and set local attribute
 *     String userId = ...;
 *     req.set("userId", userId);
 *   });
 *
 *   use("*", new RequestLogger(req -> {
 *     return req.get("userId");
 *   }));
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Here an application filter set an <code>userId</code> request attribute and then we provide that
 * <code>userId</code> to {@link RequestLogger}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>custom log function</h2>
 * <p>
 * By default it uses the underlying logging system: <a href="http://logback.qos.ch">logback</a>.
 * That's why we previously show how to configure the <code>org.jooby.RequestLogger</code> in
 * <code>logback.xml</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you want to log somewhere else and/or use a different technology then:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   use("*", new ResponseLogger()
 *     .log(line -> {
 *       System.out.println(line);
 *     }));
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * This is just an example but of course you can log the <code>NCSA</code> line to database, jms
 * queue, etc...
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>latency</h2>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   use("*", new RequestLogger()
 *       .latency());
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * It add a new entry at the last of the <code>NCSA</code> output that represents the number of
 * <code>ms</code> it took to process the incoming release.
 *
 * <h2>extended</h2>
 * <p>
 * Extend the <code>NCSA</code> by adding the <code>Referer</code> and <code>User-Agent</code>
 * headers to the output.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>dateFormatter</h2>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   use("*", new RequestLogger()
 *       .dateFormatter(ts -> ...));
 *
 *   // OR
 *   use("*", new RequestLogger()
 *       .dateFormatter(DateTimeFormatter...));
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Override, the default formatter for the request arrival time defined by:
 * {@link Request#timestamp()}. You can provide a function or an instance of
 * {@link DateTimeFormatter}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The default formatter use the default server time zone, provided by
 * {@link ZoneId#systemDefault()}. It's possible to just override the time zone (not the entirely
 * formatter) too:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   use("*", new RequestLogger()
 *      .dateFormatter(ZoneId.of("UTC"));
 * }
 * }</pre>
