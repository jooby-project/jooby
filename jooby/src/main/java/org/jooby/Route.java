 *           the Derivative Works; and
 *
 *       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

 *           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 *           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 *           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 *           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 *           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 *           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 *           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 *           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 *           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 *           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 *           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 *           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 *           as modifying the License.
 *
 *       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 *       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 *    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 *       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 *       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *
 *    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 *       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 *       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 *       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 *       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 *       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 *
 *    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

/**
 * Routes are a key concept in Jooby. Routes are executed in the same order they are defined.
 *
 * <h1>handlers</h1>
 * <p>
 * There are few type of handlers: {@link Route.Handler}, {@link Route.OneArgHandler}
 * {@link Route.ZeroArgHandler} and {@link Route.Filter}. They behave very similar, except that a
 * {@link Route.Filter} can decide if the next route handler can be executed or not. For example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   get("/filter", (req, rsp, chain) {@literal ->} {
 *     if (someCondition) {
 *       chain.next(req, rsp);
 *     } else {
 *       // respond, throw err, etc...
 *     }
 *   });
 * </pre>
 *
 * While a {@link Route.Handler} always execute the next handler:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   get("/path", (req, rsp) {@literal ->} {
 *     rsp.send("handler");
 *   });
 *
 *   // filter version
 *   get("/path", (req, rsp, chain) {@literal ->} {
 *     rsp.send("handler");
 *     chain.next(req, rsp);
 *   });
 * </pre>
 *
 * The {@link Route.OneArgHandler} and {@link Route.ZeroArgHandler} offers a functional version of
 * generating a response:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   get("/path", req -> "handler");
 *
 *   get("/path", () -> "handler");
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * There is no need to call {@link Response#send(Object)}.
 *
 * <h1>path patterns</h1>
 * <p>
 * Jooby supports Ant-style path patterns:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Some examples:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code com/t?st.html} - matches {@code com/test.html} but also {@code com/tast.jsp} or
 * {@code com/txst.html}</li>
 * <li>{@code com/*.html} - matches all {@code .html} files in the {@code com} directory</li>
 * <li><code>com/{@literal **}/test.html</code> - matches all {@code test.html} files underneath the
 * {@code com} path</li>
 * <li>{@code **}/{@code *} - matches any path at any level.</li>
 * <li>{@code *} - matches any path at any level, shorthand for {@code **}/{@code *}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>variables</h2>
 * <p>
 * Jooby supports path parameters too:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Some examples:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><code> /user/{id}</code> - /user/* and give you access to the <code>id</code> var.</li>
 * <li><code> /user/:id</code> - /user/* and give you access to the <code>id</code> var.</li>
 * <li><code> /user/{id:\\d+}</code> - /user/[digits] and give you access to the numeric
 * <code>id</code> var.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h1>routes semantic</h1>
 * <p>
 * Routes are executed in the order they are defined, for example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   get("/", (req, rsp) {@literal ->} {
 *     log.info("first"); // start here and go to second
 *   });
 *
 *   get("/", (req, rsp) {@literal ->} {
 *     log.info("second"); // execute after first and go to final
 *   });
 *
 *   get("/", (req, rsp) {@literal ->} {
 *     rsp.send("final"); // done!
 *   });
 * </pre>
 *
 * Please note first and second routes are converted to a filter, so previous example is the same
 * as:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   get("/", (req, rsp, chain) {@literal ->} {
 *     log.info("first"); // start here and go to second
 *     chain.next(req, rsp);
 *   });
 *
 *   get("/", (req, rsp, chain) {@literal ->} {
 *     log.info("second"); // execute after first and go to final
 *     chain.next(req, rsp);
 *   });
 *
 *   get("/", (req, rsp) {@literal ->} {
 *     rsp.send("final"); // done!
 *   });
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>script route</h2>
 * <p>
 * A script route can be defined using Lambda expressions, like:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   get("/", (request, response) {@literal ->} {
 *     response.send("Hello Jooby");
 *   });
 * </pre>
 *
 * Due to the use of lambdas a route is a singleton and you should NOT use global variables.
 * For example this is a bad practice:
 *
 * <pre>
 *  List{@literal <}String{@literal >} names = new ArrayList{@literal <>}(); // names produces side effects
 *  get("/", (req, rsp) {@literal ->} {
 *     names.add(req.param("name").value();
 *     // response will be different between calls.
 *     rsp.send(names);
 *   });
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>mvc Route</h2>
 * <p>
 * A Mvc Route use annotations to define routes:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {
 *   use(MyRoute.class);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * MyRoute.java:
 * <pre>
 *   {@literal @}Path("/")
 *   public class MyRoute {
 *
 *    {@literal @}GET
 *    public String hello() {
 *      return "Hello Jooby";
 *    }
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Programming model is quite similar to JAX-RS/Jersey with some minor differences and/or
 * simplifications.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To learn more about Mvc Routes, please check {@link org.jooby.mvc.Path},
 * {@link org.jooby.mvc.Produces} {@link org.jooby.mvc.Consumes}.
 * </p>

   *
   *      get("/bar", () -> "bar");
   *

   * }
   * }</pre>
   *

   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * {
   *    with(() -> {
   *      get("/str", () -> "str");
   *
   *      get("/int", () -> 1);
   *

   * }
   * }</pre>
   *
   * A call to <code>/str</code> produces <code>{str}</code>, while <code>/int</code> just
   * <code>1</code>.
   *
   * <strong>NOTE</strong>: You can apply the map operator to routes that produces an output.
   *
   * For example, the map operator will be silently ignored here:
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * {
   *    get("/", (req, rsp) -> {
   *      rsp.send(...);
