 * that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 * as modifying the License.
 *
 * You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 * may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 * for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 * for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

 * unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 * negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 * liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 * incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 * result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 * Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
