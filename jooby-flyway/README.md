# jooby-flyway

Run database migrations on startup and exposes a [Flyway](http://flywaydb.org) instance.

## dependency

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.jooby</groupId>
  <artifactId>jooby-flywaydb</artifactId>
  <version>0.11.2</version>
</dependency>
```
## usage

```properties
flyway.url = ...
flyway.user = ...
flyway.password = ...
```

```java
{
  use(new Jdbc());

  use(new Flywaydb());
}
```

If for any reason you need to maintain two or more databases:

```properties
flyway.db1.url = "..."
flyway.db1.locations = db1/migration

flyway.db2.url = "..."
flyway.db2.locations = db2/migration
```

```java
{
  use(new Flywaydb("flyway.db1"));
  use(new Flywaydb("flyway.db2"));
}
```

## migration scripts

[Flyway](http://flywaydb.org) looks for migration scripts at the ```db/migration``` classpath location.
We recommend to use [Semantic versioning](http://semver.org) for naming the migration scripts:

```
v0.1.0_My_description.sql
v0.1.1_My_small_change.sql
```

## commands
It is possible to run [Flyway](http://flywaydb.org) commands on startup, default command is: ```migrate```.

If you need to run multiple commands, set the ```flyway.run``` property:

```properties
flyway.run = [clean, migrate, validate, info]
```

## configuration

Configuration is done via ```application.conf``` under the ```flyway.*``` path.
There are some defaults setting that you can see in the appendix.


For more information, please visit the [Flyway](http://flywaydb.org) site.

Happy coding!!!

# List of schemas managed by Flyway. These schema names are case-sensitive.
# (default: The default schema for the datasource connection)
# Consequences:
# - The first schema in the list will be automatically set as the default one during the migration.
# - The first schema in the list will also be the one containing the metadata table.
# - The schemas will be cleaned in the order of this list.
# flyway.schemas=

# Name of Flyway's metadata table (default: schema_version)
# By default (single-schema mode) the metadata table is placed in the default schema for the connection provided by the datasource.
# When the flyway.schemas property is set (multi-schema mode), the metadata table is placed in the first schema of the list.
# flyway.table=

# List of locations to scan recursively for migrations.
# The location type is determined by its prefix.
# Unprefixed locations or locations starting with classpath: point to a package on the classpath and may contain both sql and java-based migrations.
# Locations starting with filesystem: point to a directory on the filesystem and may only contain sql migrations.

# List of fully qualified class names of custom MigrationResolver to use for resolving migrations.
# flyway.resolvers=

# File name prefix for Sql migrations (default: v )
# Sql migrations have the following file name structure: prefixVERSIONseparatorDESCRIPTIONsuffix ,
# which using the defaults translates to V1_1__My_description.sql

# File name separator for Sql migrations (default: _)
# Sql migrations have the following file name structure: prefixVERSIONseparatorDESCRIPTIONsuffix ,

# Target version up to which Flyway should consider migrations.
# The special value 'current' designates the current version of the schema. (default: <<latest version>>)
# flyway.target=

# Whether to automatically call validate or not when running migrate. (default: true)
# flyway.validateOnMigrate=

# Whether to automatically call clean or not when a validation error occurs. (default: false)
# This is exclusively intended as a convenience for development. Even tough we
# strongly recommend not to change migration scripts once they have been checked into SCM and run, this provides a
# way of dealing with this case in a smooth manner. The database will be wiped clean automatically, ensuring that
# the next migration will bring you back to the state checked into SCM.
# Warning ! Do not enable in production !
# flyway.cleanOnValidationError=

# The version to tag an existing schema with when executing baseline. (default: 1)
# flyway.baselineVersion=

# The description to tag an existing schema with when executing baseline. (default: << Flyway Baseline >>)
# flyway.baselineDescription=

# Whether to automatically call baseline when migrate is executed against a non-empty schema with no metadata table.
# This schema will then be initialized with the baselineVersion before executing the migrations.
# Only migrations above baselineVersion will then be applied.
# This is useful for initial Flyway production deployments on projects with an existing DB.
# Be careful when enabling this as it removes the safety net that ensures
# Flyway does not migrate the wrong database in case of a configuration mistake! (default: false)
# flyway.baselineOnMigrate=

# Allows migrations to be run "out of order" (default: false).
# If you already have versions 1 and 3 applied, and now a version 2 is found,
# it will be applied too instead of being ignored.
# flyway.outOfOrder=

# This allows you to tie in custom code and logic to the Flyway lifecycle notifications (default: empty).
# Set this to a comma-separated list of fully qualified FlywayCallback class name implementations
# flyway.callbacks=
